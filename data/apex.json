Prior to his release, fans were concerned that his ability kit would overlap with Lifeline's and ultimately drown her out - and it looks like those concerns were somewhat justified. It's only been a week, but Newcastle is already being picked over twice as much as Lifeline in-game.</p>\n<p>Looking at <a href=\"https://apexlegendsstatus.com/game-stats/legends-pick-rates\">Apex Legends Status</a>, we can see that at the time of writing Newcastle is being picked roughly 8% of the time. Meanwhile Lifeline is sitting at 3.9%. This equates to roughly a 5% change in popularity for Lifeline - a major drop. These numbers might seem small, but when you consider Apex Legends' huge player count, it's actually quite a large number of players.</p>\n<p>Of course, this could just be a temporary swing in popularity that reflects the fact that Newcastle is the newest legend in the game. However, the concerns expressed by players aren't unfounded and Lifeline mains have been calling for change for some time now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/newcastle-lifeline-pick-rate\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the best legends for Season 13</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-worlds-edge-returns\">World's Edge returns to Apex Legends today after 98-day absence</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-changes-imperialhal\">TSM's ImperialHal defends divisive Apex Legends ranked changes</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1652984793, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4292505348821833205", "title": "World's Edge is back in Apex Legends, which means we're dropping Fragment", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/VG247/4292505348821833205", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://asset.vg247.com/apex_worlds_edge_SEH0jrh.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex_worlds_edge_SEH0jrh.jpg\" /> <p>World\u2019s Edge is back in <a href=\"/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>, and any long term player will know what that means.

Well, for one, it\u2019s massive. Even with a large number of squads dropping there, you\u2019ll likely be able to find a decent amount of loot for you and your buddies to pick up and use against other squads.

The map was completely absent in Season 12, and the first seven days of Season 13 have been played exclusively on Storm Point, but today, it returns.</p>\n<p>World's Edge is generally considered to be many players' favourite map, but it's also the top choice for pro and competitive play, too, which is why players will be glad to see it find its way back into Apex Legends' map rotation for Season 13. Right now, it's only in regular lobbies, as <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a> players will have Storm Point as their Split 1 map this season. The map for Split 2 is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>The map is one that provides great diversity in its locations, from the ice cold Epicenter to the fiery flames of the Thermal Station. Almost every area of World's Edge is ripe for looting and gunfighting, and that's what makes it such a compelling map for players. The majority of the community are more than happy for it to be back after more than three months on the sidelines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-worlds-edge-returns\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/newcastle-lifeline-pick-rate\">Apex Legends' Newcastle popularity sees Lifeline pick rate tumble</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the best legends for Season 13</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-changes-imperialhal\">TSM's ImperialHal defends divisive Apex Legends ranked changes</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1652805589, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5849624375832774635", "title": "TSM's ImperialHal defends divisive Apex Legends ranked changes", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/5849624375832774635", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/apex-legends-ranked-changes-season-13-900x506.jpg\"/><p>We're not even a full week into <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> Season 13, and already the modifications to the battle royale's ranked mode are causing a bit of a stir. For this season, Respawn has altered the way that you earn RP in ranked matches, and it's generally made moving up the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a> tougher than in previous seasons.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/uqax88/is_this_what_respawn_had_in_mind_for_their_changes/?sort=top\">a Reddit post</a> highlighting Season 13's rank distribution sparked a lot of conversation around whether the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/saviors-ranked-update\">ranked changes</a> have improved or worsened the ranked experience. While it is slightly trivial to look at rank distribution this early in a split, the post in question does show that the majority of players have failed to move past the first three ranks of Rookie (newly added for Season 13), Bronze 4, and Bronze 3.</p>\n<p>With the climb up the ranks clearly getting tougher, and the emphasis on placements and teamwork becoming a talking point for solo players, a lot of casual players have been quick to find fault with the new system. However, for the battle royale's top players, the changes are being seen as a real positive, and many have praised and defended the changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-changes-imperialhal\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list - the best legends for Season 13</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-worlds-edge-returns\">World's Edge returns to Apex Legends today after 98-day absence</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/mobile-lifeline-kills-liechtenstein\">Apex Legends' Lifeline has killed a country's worth of people</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1652707704, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5849624375827914795", "title": "\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430: Apex Legends \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 Steam", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/5849624375827914795", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News166956/b4d49dbdec-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 10 \u043c\u0430\u044f \u0432 <strong>Apex Legends</strong> \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \"\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\"\u00a0\u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0439\u00a0<a href=\"https://gamemag.ru/news/166365/apex-legends-saviors-launch-cinematic-trailer-showcases-newcastle\"><strong>\u041d\u044c\u044e\u043a\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043c</strong></a>, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0451\u043a \u043a \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 <strong>Steam</strong> \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u043e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u043c.</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1652560320, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5849624375821933156", "title": "Apex Legends' Lifeline has killed a country's worth of people", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/5849624375821933156", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/apex-legends-mobile-lifeline-kills-900x506.jpeg\"/><p>When you look at Lifeline, <a href=\"http://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' sole healer, you wouldn't automatically assume that she's a cold-hearted killer.

While there's plenty to mull over, the headline changes include nerfs to all four of the game's LMGs, an interesting tweak to the battle royale's two Fortified legends (Gibraltar and Caustic), and a buff to the Apex Games' most forgettable competitor, Rampart.</p>\n<p>So, let's start with those weapon changes shall we? Nine weapons are getting their base stats tweaked in Apex Legends Season 13, most of which are nerfs. The headline changes are the nerfs coming to all four of the battle royale's light machine guns (the Spitfire, L-STAR, Rampage, and Devotion) and to the game's god-like Kraber sniper rifle. The Kraber has had its headshot multiplier slashed, and when coupled with a headshot protection buff to blue and purple helmets, your one-shot Kraber kills are gonna get a whole lot harder.</p>\n<p>Shotguns are also getting tinkered in Season 13, with the Peacekeeper and Mozambique getting small buffs, while the Mastiff (which is this season's crate weapon) also getting some balance changes.

Well, at the moment, a Knockdown Shield is only recharged when the player using it is no longer down - whether that is them being revived, or them being killed.

Apex Legends players will only be able to activate and use Storm Point's new IMC Armories once per game - and with there only being four of these dotted around the map at launch, it's not going to be easy to jump in and reap the rewards unbothered.</p>\n<p>Explaining Respawn Entertainment's decision to limit the use of an IMC Armory to once per game, Kalman expressed that the development team had to consider \"what if the ring closes near [an IMC Armory]\" and how they would affect the latter stages of a game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-map-changes\">Apex Legends' Season 13 map changes add loot hotspot to Storm Point</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 13 release date - when does Saviors come out?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1651687731, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348799067304860584", "title": "Apex Legends devs reveal what drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4348799067304860584", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Apex-Legends-storm-point-downed-beast-reason-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> is full of strange secrets and things are only getting more mysterious with Season 13 and the Saviors update. One of the biggest mysteries at the moment is centred on Storm Point's new Downed Beast POI. Fans want to know what-exactly drew the monstrous sea creature to shore and what implications this has for the future. So, ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-release-date\">Apex Legends Season 13 release date</a>, we asked Respawn Entertainment what exactly drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point - and the answer wasn't what we expected.</p>\n<p>In the opening moments of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOFuEQEvC3E&t=50s\">Apex Legends Saviors Gameplay Trailer</a>, the narrator expresses that \"we may never have the answers\" to burning questions like \"where did the creature come from\" and \"why did it attack\". However, speaking to The Loadout, gameplay director Steve Ferreira has revealed that the giant sea monster was drawn to Storm Point by its stomach and the hunt for \"tasty leviathans\".</p>\n<p>We know that sounds hard to believe, but that's the answer we got - and it makes sense when you look at the teasers Respawn Entertainment released in the build-up to the reveal of Apex Legends' Saviors update.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/downed-beast-storm-point\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-newcastle-second-passive\">Apex Legends Season 13's Newcastle has a secret second passive</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Apex Legends' Season 13 Storm Point IMC Armories are one-use per game</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1651596951, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348798430292772324", "title": "Apex Legends looking to \"remix\" LTMs like Control for future seasons", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4348798430292772324", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/apex-legends-ltm-remix-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' Season 13 update is almost here and it's shaping up to be another stacked update - with a new legend, a major map update, and the Ranked Reloaded changes headlining proceedings. One thing that seems to be missing from Respawn Entertainment's plans, though, is limited-time modes (also known as LTMs). Fear not, though, Apex Legends players - speaking to The Loadout, game director Steve Ferreira has revealed that LTMs are still very-much the focus for the developer - and a fan-favourite LTM is going to return in the second half of the Saviors season!</p>\n<p>When asked about Respawn's plans for Apex Legends LTMs in Season 13 and beyond, Ferreira explained that \"something [players] are going to see is the continued addition of LTMs\" and \"remixes of past LTMs\".</p>\n<p>Elaborating further on this point, he expressed that one \"focus of the team right now\" is \"trying out and experimenting a few different things and ways to play\" through past Apex Legends' LTMs. So, while we might not be getting anything drastically new in the future, players can still expect new experiences from Apex Legends going forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ltm-remix-control\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks - Ranked Reloaded, splits, and Season 13 explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Apex Legends' Season 13 Storm Point IMC Armories are one-use per game</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/downed-beast-storm-point\">Apex Legends devs reveal what drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1651584984, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348798430290145079", "title": "Apex Legends: Saviors Coming May 10!", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4348798430290145079", "is_external_url": true, "author": "mattrodriguez", "contents": "[previewyoutube=cOFuEQEvC3E;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nSee how new Legend Newcastle wields his shield, the monstrous changes to Storm Point and the reworked Ranked system, all coming in Apex Legends: Saviors!\n\n\n[previewyoutube=5ISMishWUlE;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nGet the Saviors Battle Pass and fight your way through Daily and Weekly Challenges to earn over 100 new rewards like Legendary skins for Fuse, Bloodhound and the C.A.R.

There's nothing worse than being on the cusp of victory to find yourself being shot in the back by an unseen assailant. Apex Legends does give you ways to combat this - Gibby's dome shield is a particularly useful tool to have - but it's largely a fact of life that, at some point, you're going to be third-partied. Well, until now. Speaking to press, Samantha Kalman, senior game designer at Respawn Entertainment, has revealed that Storm Point's IMC Armory locations are actually going to be third-party proof.</p>\n<p>We know that this is hard to believe, but it's true. When you head into one of Storm Point's four IMC Armory locations to loot, \"you're protected from being third-partied\", according to Kalman. However, this comes at a cost - as you might expect.</p>\n<p>Players looking to loot these locations are going to have to lock themselves in and weather an intense minute-long storm of close-quarters combat with waves of deadly Spectres - automated infantry robots you may recognise from Titanfall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/imc-armory-third-party\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-imc-armories-one-use\">Apex Legends' Season 13 Storm Point IMC Armories are one-use per game</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/downed-beast-storm-point\">Apex Legends devs reveal what drew the Downed Beast to Storm Point</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ltm-remix-control\">Apex Legends looking to \"remix\" LTMs like Control for future seasons</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1651511135, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348798430289452652", "title": "Apex Legends season 13 lets you duke it out in the body of a giant dead monster", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/VG247/4348798430289452652", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://asset.vg247.com/apex-legends-saviors-season-13.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-legends-saviors-season-13.jpg\" /> <p><strong>Apex Legends</strong> has shown off some gameplay for season 13, giving us a look at Newcastle in action, and revealing a new part of the map that's literally the dead body of a giant creature.</p><p><strong>Respawn Entertainment</strong> released a cinematic trailer <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-saviors-newcastle-cinematic-trailer\">last week</a> officially revealing the newest character Newcastle, but the developer has now given us a look at the man in action, as well as a big change that's coming to Storm Point.

While it wasn't clear if the creature would be some kind of player vs environment task in the first trailer, it's now confirmed to definitely just be a map change.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-season-13-lets-you-duke-it-out-in-the-body-of-a-giant-dead-monster\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "VG247", "date": 1651506339, "feedname": "VG247", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348798430289681367", "title": "Apex Legends Season 13 introducing Smart Supply Bins to Storm Point", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4348798430289681367", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/apex-legends-smart-supply-bins-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> players, both new and old, will know how important looting is to a successful game.

Thankfully, Respawn Entertainment is giving Apex Legends players more ways to get high-tier loot in Season 13 through the introduction of Smart Supply Bins to Storm Point.</p>\n<p>If you're wondering what a Smart Supply Bin actually is, you're not alone. Speaking to the press, senior game designer Samantha Kalman has explained that this is a new type of Supply Bin that's always going to give you better equipment and weapons - no matter what.</p>\n<p>Smart Supply Bins \"are filled with loot based on scanning your current equipment and weapons\", Kalman explains. \"This means the loot is always valuable.

The new season, titled <strong>Saviors</strong>, seems to be coming with monstrous changes to Storm Point as that\u2019s where the events of the trailer takes place. </p><p>However, while an altered map is in the background, <strong>Newcastle</strong> takes centre stage as the star of the video and the 21st character to join the Apex Legends roster. While we don\u2019t know exactly what the character can do in game at this point, certain info can be ascertained from the trailer which we\u2019ve embedded below.</p><p>We\u2019ll start by focusing on what we can see Newcastle doing combat-wise, rather than the narrative info revealed. Newcastle seems to be able to throw out a front-facing barrier in front of him, which provides additional cover for his teammates. In fact, much of what they do in this trailer revolves around blocking attacks, be it shots from nearby robots or giant laser beams. It\u2019s hard to differentiate cinematic flavour from actual abilities, but it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ll be a defensive Legend.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-saviors-newcastle-cinematic-trailer\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "VG247", "date": 1650965370, "feedname": "VG247", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348797798092477949", "title": "Apex Legends: Saviors Launch Trailer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4348797798092477949", "is_external_url": true, "author": "marty", "contents": "[previewyoutube=cheYIVEtVQ4;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nWhen a monstrous beast attacks Storm Point, new Legend Newcastle leaps into the fray to protect and inspire his fellow Legends: because that\u2019s what heroes are for.  \n\nLearn more about Apex Legends: Saviors: [url=http://x.ea.com/73331]http://x.ea.com/73331 [/url]", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1650952811, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4348797798090672763", "title": "Apex Legends \"reworked ranked system\" coming in Season 13", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4348797798090672763", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/apex-legends-season-13-ranked-changes-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> has just teed up what is to come in Season 13, and as well as its <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-character-reveal\">newest legend Newcastle</a> and a massive sea monster, Respawn has teased that a rework to the battle royale's ranked mode is on the way.</p>\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/saviors\">official Apex Legends website</a>, Respawn gives a brief overview of what is to come in Season 13.

This mode isn't easy, replacing all healing items with several healing zones at fixed points across the map. If you're struggling with the lack of healing on offer, we suggest switching out to Revenant for a while. Why? One Reddit user has discovered an Apex Legends Revenant glitch that allows him to heal, while being invulnerable, in Flashpoint.</p>\n<p>'<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/u7vq5y/revenant_can_heal_while_in_death_protection_in/\">RossBobSquirrel</a>', a Redditor known for uncovering exploits and Easter eggs in Apex Legends, has shared a clip confirming that Revenant can heal in a Flashpoint Zone during a match of Flashpoint while benefiting from the Death Protection bonus you get from using his Death Totem ultimate ability.</p>\n<p>Why is this a big deal? Well, usually, players with this Death Protection buff active can't use any healing items and, when they die, they are returned to the Death Totem with a maximum of 50 health. With the constant healing of a Flashpoint Zone, it's clear to see why this would make winning a fight with a Revenant and his squad with Death Protection near-impossible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/revenant-glitch-flashpoint\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-ranked-changes\">Apex Legends \"reworked ranked system\" coming in Season 13</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-character-reveal\">Apex Legends' Season 13 character confirmed in latest cinematic</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-teasers\">Apex Legends Season 13 teasers hint at arrival of huge sea monster</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1650547169, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5493837466498295156", "title": "Flashpoint Returns, New Cosmetics, And More In The Unshackled Event", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/5493837466498295156", "is_external_url": true, "author": "marty", "contents": "[previewyoutube=YCAKDHHEubs;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h2]FLASHPOINT RETURNS![/h2]\n\nPlay on Olympus as you never have before in the return of the popular limited-time mode, Flashpoint!

Observation Deck is higher up, but limits verticality with lower ceilings. Deployment Line is the effective mid-lane for this Arena map and moving containers offer dynamic cover opportunities mid-fight.

Reversing the flow of gravity, this ability lifts players 30 metres off the ground and throws them out into the air - which can be useful in both offensive and defensive situations. In its current form, Gravity Lift only pushes players up - however, that wasn't always the case. Apex Legends' lead software engineer, Chris Winder, has revealed that Respawn previously attempted to have Gravity Lift work in every direction.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/t87cm5/name_your_main_and_i_will_reply_with_a_buffnerf/hznlait/?context=1000\">Reddit post</a> discussing legend buffs and nerfs, 'mufasakong' suggests a Horizon buff that would allow players to \"attach [Gravity Lift] to any surface\", which would push players in the direction the tactical is facing.</p>\n<p>Responding to this, 'RV-GameplayChris' - who we identified as Winder - reveals that Respawn actually tried this while developing Horizon and her kit. \"We tried this! It was crazy! And unpredictable\", Winder says. However, it was simply \"not that fun\" when you take into account just how varied the terrain is in Apex Legends' maps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-gravity-lift-scrapped-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/steam-player-count-february-2022\">Apex Legends Steam player count skyrockets to all-time high</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked - ranks, splits, and Season 12 scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list - the best guns in the battle royale game</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1646654811, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4246335832526775945", "title": "Apex Legends Steam player count skyrockets to all-time high", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4246335832526775945", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apex-legends-steam-player-count-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Respawn's battle royale Apex Legends may have been released all the way back in 2019, but player statistics show that the game has just had its best month ever on Steam, with a peak player count of 392,998 - and that's only part of the story.</p>\n<p>The statistics showing the best peak player count for February 2022 come from <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1172470\">Steam Charts</a>, a website that monitors how many players are playing games from the Steam database, including tracking average, peak, and concurrent player counts for each game across time.</p>\n<p>You might have realised, then, that these numbers don't include the activity of individuals who play Apex Legends on other platforms.

This time we\u2019re doing something a little different and special to celebrate our amazing players with the introduction of Prestige Skins, Legendary Squad Skins, and a reward tracker featuring community-created cosmetics! Let\u2019s check it out.\n\n[h2]REWARD TRACKER[/h2]\nThis year we\u2019re featuring a reward track filled with 12 community-created cosmetics and more, totaling 24 event-limited skins that players can earn during the event. Check out some of the cosmetics you can earn below including some Legendary Squad Skins created based off fan favorites from the past.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/0c627b2f16f40a31c99216b981853930907b0724.jpg[/img]\n\nSpecial thanks to the following creators who contributed to the tracker: Akka_0510, BadgerBitten, Bamwoozle, Cryophase, FrAgMenTIx, Hunnypuzzle, iiTzTimmy, Iwamoto_05, LilakeyLK, Lululuvely, Lumenzampel, MacksArts, PreetiSketch, Ryonello, ShibuyaHal, StylishNoob4, The Gaming Merchant, Wisethug.\n\n[h2]NEW PRESTIGE SKINS[/h2]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/0dffedf8fb70b08aa00e942960c85e8171878e75.gif[/img][img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/3fb2e642a454abd05a9e66b0af5086b8d0d53aef.gif[/img]\n\nPrestige Skins are a new rarity level cosmetic Legend skins that each have 3 tiers (3 versions total of the Prestige Skin). Upon unlocking tier 1 of a Prestige Skin, a player will be able to complete challenges to unlock Tier 2 and Tier 3 at no additional cost. Players will have an unlimited amount of time to complete these challenges once available. Once a Prestige Skin Tier\u2019s challenge is completed a player will unlock that respective tier\u2019s version of the Legend skin which can then be equipped. Players have the ability to equip any unlocked tier of a Prestige Skin once owned.\n\nExample: A player unlocks Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin. In order to unlock Tier 2 Bloodhound Prestige Skin, a player must complete the following challenge: Deal 30,000 damage with Bloodhound. The challenge begins the moment Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin is unlocked. Once a player unlocks Tier 2 Bloodhound Prestige Skin, they will then be eligible to start the challenge for Tier 3 Bloodhound Prestige Skin: Deal 70,000 additional damage with Bloodhound. Once Tier 3 Bloodhound Prestige Skin challenge is completed the player will unlock Tier 3 Bloodhound Prestige Skin, which not only looks great but also comes with a special finisher called, \u201cPiercing Plasma\u201d.\n\nAfter the 3rd Anniversary Collection Event ends, the Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin will become available in the Mythics Shop for 150 Heirloom shards.\n\n[h2]SQUAD SKINS[/h2]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/67e9f1c1da1c3da3dcc74008baccdca6ee78115e.png[/img]\n\nAlso during the event, you\u2019ll be able to purchase Legendary Squad Skins that are themed based on some fan favorites from the past. For example, during the event we\u2019ll have Squad Skins inspired by Crypto\u2019s \u201cHypebeast\u201d, Caustic\u2019s \u201cBlackheart\u201d, skins, and more!\n\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Anniversary Collection Event Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you\u2019ll unlock the Tier 1 Bloodhound Prestige Skin (Apex Hunter).\n\n[h2]EVENT STORE[/h2]\nAlso, make sure to check out the Event Store where we\u2019ll have lots of special offers throughout the event.

The headline and copy has been updated to reflect this.</p>\n<p>Apex Legends' Anniversary collection event kicked off earlier this week, but it's not all happy celebrations for Bloodhound players - despite the fact that they have a new mythic-rarity skin to unlock. The skin's high value of around $160 is dividing fans on its own, but there are also reports that the skin's challenge tracking is broken. Thankfully, this issue has been quickly addressed by Respawn Entertainment.</p>\n<p>Bloodhound's new Apex Hunter skin has three tiers of challenges for players to unlock, each offering a different take on the skin's core design. Tier 1 can be unlocked by completing the Anniversary collection event - the same way you would be able to unlock an heirloom item. Tier 2 and Tier 3, however, are unlocked through in-game challenges. This skin's challenges are all about dealing damage while playing as Bloodhound.</p>\n<p>This sounds straightforward, but a lot of players are struggling to actually complete the challenge. There are multiple reports of the challenge tracking being broken.

The lengthy patch notes go over most of the already-revealed changes and additions in detail - such as balancing <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-legend-changes\">tweaks to Caustic and Crypto</a>, a new hop up, and <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/defiance-map-changes\">Olympus' map changes</a> - but there are also some new bits of information too.</p>\n<p>One of the most eye-catching changes involves the latest map to be added to Apex Legends, Storm Point. While most players have been relatively happy with the map, its experimental PvE wildlife mechanic has had its critics - particularly regarding the Prowlers that stalk the map. In Season 12, the Prowlers are getting a general nerf that will make them less frustrating to come up against, and will also become more lucrative to defeat if you choose to do so.</p>\n<p>You will now get 150 Crafting Material by completing standard Prowler nests, 250 for clearing the larger nest in the centre of the map, and high-tier loot will drop slightly more often from all wildlife in Season 12. Players will also be happy to learn that they cannot be completely swarmed by Prowlers any more - only three can lock on to an individual player at a time. They'll also no longer engage you when you're outside of the ring and scrambling for safety - that is unless you engage them first.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-prowler-nerfs-storm-point\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bad-player-data-error-fix\">Apex Legends bad player data error - how to fix this issue</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-rating\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ratings have surfaced</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1644259116, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4235074931851052564", "title": "\"\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0412\u043d\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f\u0445\": \u0421\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 Apex Legends \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044f\u0442 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u2014 \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041c\u044d\u0433\u0433\u0438", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4235074931851052564", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News163933/380c2ec0dc-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u0421\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u044f <strong>Respawn Entertainment </strong>\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b <strong>Apex Legends</strong>. \u0412 \u043d\u0451\u043c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044f\u0442 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0441 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u044b - <strong>\u0411\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041c\u044d\u0433\u0433\u0438</strong> (\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u044f - \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u0445\u0435\u0440\u0435).</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1643987700, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4235074931847640688", "title": "PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Apex Legends may be coming soon", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/VG247/4235074931847640688", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://asset.vg247.com/apex_legends_next_gen_versions.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex_legends_next_gen_versions.jpg\" /> <p>During a preview event for<strong> Apex Legends Defiance</strong>, the upcoming update for the popular battle royale from Respawn Entertainment, it was next gen versions for the game were teased as something the Apex community can expect in the near future.

It's clear that Maggie's kit is preserving the essence of this character, but Wilder reveals that there were quite a few iterations of this \"breacher\" before Maggie's kit was settled on.</p>\n<p>Respawn was aware that creating a balanced character was important - Apex Legends has a lot of \"open ground\" in-between its buildings - and this led to the design team testing a number of abilities.

We learned <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-ltm-details\">a load of new details about it</a> earlier this week thanks to a media event - including that Lifeline's ultimate has been tweaked for the mode and that players will have infinite ammo - but we were still left a tad perplexed when it comes to team composition.</p>\n<p>In Control, the nine-legend squads are essentially made up of three traditional Apex trios - and yes, that means you can't nine-stack. In the mode, players can freely swap which legend they play as after death while waiting to be respawned, so you aren't tied down to just one character per match. In trailer footage for Control, we saw a few instances where two of the same legend were competing on the same team, confirming you do not need nine unique legends on a team.

With two new POIs, Phase Driver and Terminal, and an expanded playable area on the south side of the map, Olympus is going to be bigger and better than ever before.</p>\n<p>Terminal is being introduced to offer a new route into Hammond Labs from Bonsai Plaza and several minor changes have been made throughout the map to help with rotation into - and more importantly out of - choke points. Phase Driver, on the other hand, is going to offer players a new way to get their hands on high-tier loot in the early game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/olympus-map-update-season-12\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-legend-development\">Apex Legends' Maggie stole abilities designed for another legend</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-version-news\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S update news coming \"very, very soon\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-teams\">Apex Legends Control teams can have up to three of the same legend</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1643731314, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104338150002", "title": "Apex Legends Season 12 nerfs Caustic traps and improves Crypto's drones", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4237326104338150002", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/apex-legends-crypto-drone-changes-900x506.jpg\"/><p>The build up to any new Apex Legends season can be a nervy time for players. Will my main get nerfed into oblivion? Will my favourite legend finally become viable to play? Well, for two of the battle royale's most frustrating legends, their time under the microscope is now.</p>\n<p>During a media event, balance designer John Larson reveals that the two legends getting tweaked for Apex Legends Season 12 are Caustic and Crypto. Caustic is receiving a nerf that will make his Nox Gas Traps a bit less formidable, while Crypto mains will receive a new way to use his surveillance drones.</p>\n<p>So, let's take a look at Caustic first. In previous seasons, the legend's notoriously annoying gas traps could only be destroyed before they detonated. However, players can now destroy them after they've been triggered, which means no matter how sneakily you conceal your gas trap, it can still be removed and the onslaught of gas can be halted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-12-legend-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-legend-development\">Apex Legends' Maggie stole abilities designed for another legend</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-version-news\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S update news coming \"very, very soon\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-teams\">Apex Legends Control teams can have up to three of the same legend</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1643731310, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104338140240", "title": "Here's everything we know about Control in Apex Legends: Defiance", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/VG247/4237326104338140240", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://asset.vg247.com/apex_legends_control_breakdown.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex_legends_control_breakdown.jpg\" /> <p>Every now and again, the good folk at Respawn give us a fancy new game mode to muck around with when the trials and tribulations of battle royale get a tad too stressful. Control is the latest example of this, and will be dropping alongside Apex Legends; Defiance February 8. For those who want to hit the ground running, we\u2019ve compiled everything we know about Control to help you get to grips with this new experience.</p><p>This article will break down what Control is, how things like looting and abilities work in Control, and the future of other modes that differ greatly from the standard battle royale. This information comes from a developer Q&A where game designer David Sweiczko filled us in on many of the details.</p><p>Here are the basics. Control is a 9v9 mode, where teams fight to control three locations on the map. As time progresses these locations controlled by teams provide points. Once a team possesses a certain number of points they win - you\u2019re typical King of the Hill game mode many FPS players will be familiar with.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-everything-on-control\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "VG247", "date": 1643731281, "feedname": "VG247", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104338140247", "title": "Here are all the changes to Olympus coming with Apex Legends: Defiance", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/VG247/4237326104338140247", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://asset.vg247.com/apex_legends_olympus_changes.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex_legends_olympus_changes.jpg\" /> <p>If there\u2019s one massive aspect of the new <strong>Apex Legends</strong> season that stands out - aside from the introduction of Mad Maggie of course - it\u2019s the <strong>overhaul of Olympus</strong>. This map, a floating research base, has its fair share of problems in its current non-damaged iteration. For those looking to dominate in this fresh new season, a full rundown on Olympus changes is invaluable.</p><p>During a Q/A, we got plenty of new information on the changes coming to Olympus straight from level designer Alex Graner and world director Eduardo Agostini who both talked at length at what was described as probably the most ambitious map update to date.</p><p>First and foremost, there are some new points of interest coming to the reworked version of Olympus. The first is the Phase Driver, positioned in the formerly-empty spot between Bonsai and Hydroponics. This mechanical marvel is what caused the current disaster that\u2019s left much of Olympus unoperational and hovering over Malta. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-olympus-changes\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "VG247", "date": 1643731270, "feedname": "VG247", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104338150007", "title": "Here are six things you didn't know about Apex Legends' Control mode", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4237326104338150007", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/apex-legends-control-mode-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Nine-versus-nine, unlimited respawn, objective-based Apex Legends?

The new Control limited-time mode that is coming on February 8 with the Apex Season 12 Defiance update has really intrigued players, and while <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/control-ltm-blog\">a blog post</a> outlined most of the details about it, there were still some questions left unanswered.</p>\n<p>However, at a media event, the masterminds behind Control went in even deeper on this chaotic LTM to reveal even more interesting details. We won't bore you with all the stuff you've probably read in the blog post already, but here are all the new bits of info we got from game directors David Swieczko and Mark Yampolsky.</p>\n<p>As this is a casual \"playground\" mode, the devs have taken an equally laid back approach to things like ammo and healing. In Control, your loadout weapons will have unlimited ammo, so you can keep blasting away to your heart's content. The only exception to the rule are the powerful crate weapons that can be obtained through Airdrop events that happen throughout the match.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-ltm-details\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/maggie-legend-development\">Apex Legends' Maggie stole abilities designed for another legend</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ps5-xbox-series-x-version-news\">Apex Legends PS5 and Xbox Series X|S update news coming \"very, very soon\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/control-teams\">Apex Legends Control teams can have up to three of the same legend</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1643731186, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104336383046", "title": "\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041c\u044d\u0433\u0433\u0438 \u0438 \u0425\u0430\u043e\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435: \u041e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0435\u0440 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430 \"\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\" \u0432 Apex Legends", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4237326104336383046", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News163827/103acd74f3-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u0421\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u044f <strong>Respawn Entertainment </strong>\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b <strong>Apex Legends</strong>. \u0412 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \"<strong>\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435</strong>\". \u041e\u043d \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 8 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430.</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1643684460, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104335281909", "title": "Apex Legends: Defiance Gameplay Trailer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4237326104335281909", "is_external_url": true, "author": "marty", "contents": "[previewyoutube=OtVABKfc_AE;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nCheck out the brand new limited-time mode Control debuting in Apex Legends: Defiance, and see new Legend Mad Maggie in action amidst the chaos of a sabotaged Olympus.\n\n[url=http://x.ea.com/72542]http://x.ea.com/72542[/url]", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1643663736, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104334510646", "title": "Apex Legends Defiance gameplay trailer shows of Control, Mad Maggie, and a ruined Olympus", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/VG247/4237326104334510646", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://asset.vg247.com/apex_legends_defiance_gameplay_trailer_header.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex_legends_defiance_gameplay_trailer_header.jpg\" /> <p>Another week, another <strong>Apex Legends</strong> trailer!

Just now, we\u2019ve just been treated to the <strong>cinematic launch trailer</strong> for the new season, which continues the ongoing story for Mad Maggie following the <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-season-12-defiance-mad-maggie\">announcement trailer released earlier in the week</a>. You can watch this new trailer embedded below!</p><p>In this trailer, we see Maggie dropped into the Apex Games on Olympus by the judge who played an antagonistic role in the previous trailer. Once on the ground, she finds her way into an underground bunker, where the mysterious character responsible for sending her to the games in the first place is found toiling away at a computer. </p><p>Eagle-eyed Apex fans will see him engaging a program by the name of Defiance on said console - the namesake of the season - before teleporting Olympus above an as of yet unidentified city. Maggie is blamed for this of course, but there might be a good reason for that (aside from Gibraltar being a jerk). The new location Olympus seems to be floating above looks strikingly familiar to the city Mad Maggie was seen leading riots in the prior trailer.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-season-12-defiance-launch-trailer\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "VG247", "date": 1643300189, "feedname": "VG247", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4237326104319966774", "title": "Apex Legends' new character Mad Maggie has a giant wrecking ball", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4237326104319966774", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-defiance-mad-maggie-face.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-legends-defiance-mad-maggie-face.jpg\" /> <p>Until recently, Mad Maggie's main claim to fame in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> was that she had a surprisingly spry 80-year-old mum, and loved to tell people about it.

They have high damage potential coupled with a punishing slow, and can be thrown more accurately than other ordnance types. Removing the stick slow created some degenerate play patterns and often made it hard to tell when you got stuck in the heat of battle. We\u2019re bringing that back with a tradeoff of lower damage potential and a proximity based slow falloff in non-stick cases. These changes make stick scenarios more consistent across shield types and make arc stars less effective at area denial.[/i]\n[h3]Splatter Rounds[/h3][list]\n[*]Removed increased magazine capacity\n[/list] [b]Dev Note[/b]: [i]Big Maude has been an awesome drop location and a reliable source of early power for teams that win the hotdrop.

Adult movie star, plumber, doctor, construction worker, and master of numerous other trades <strong>Johnny Sins</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/qw8x1j/johnny_sins_is_banned_from_apex/\">had his name censored</a> in Apex Legends. This harrowing news was uncovered by <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/kap3\">streamer Kap3</a> and posted on Reddit, it seems like typing out the actors name with proper spacing and punctuation results in both words being blocked out.</p><p>Now, chat censors are important in hugely-popular multiplayer games for obvious reasons. You can\u2019t have words that are super offensive - such as slurs - usable in a game like Apex Legends, unless you want it to become a cesspit of toxicity. However, this specific situation is a bit of a head scratcher, since while Mr. Sins is a man enveloped in subject matter that is inherently NSFW, he\u2019s not some Voldemort-esque figure nor a person whose name or work is particularly offensive. It seems as though he\u2019s just been shafted.</p><p>This funnily enough isn\u2019t the first time Johnny Sins and Apex Legends have collided. Back in Season Seven, players paid the actor on Cameo (a service that allows people to pay for personalized video messages from a wide range of celebrities) to send a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp80KIqjINw\">message</a> to Respawn Entertainment urging them to add and change certain aspects of the game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-johnny-sins-banned-name-censored-season-11\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "VG247", "date": 1637246018, "feedname": "VG247", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4227186657137628215", "title": "\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434 Apex Legends \u043d\u0430 PS5 \u0438 Xbox Series X|S \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043a \u2014 \u0432 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4227186657137628215", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Ran", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News161716/fd35d4f8fd-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u0414\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435\u0440 <strong>Shrugtal </strong>\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0430\u0445 <strong>Apex Legends </strong>\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435<strong> PS5</strong> \u0438 <strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong>. \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c 11-\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0414\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432 <strong>Apex Legends</strong> \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0430 <strong>DualSense</strong>.</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1637161380, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4186653398789335500", "title": "Market Drops New Legendary Clothing Line In Apex", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4186653398789335500", "is_external_url": true, "author": "marty", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/86c0352787cf558defb147d98b8e005d57faf640.png[/img]\n\nThe next evolution of streetwear is coming to the Apex arena thanks to Market.\n\nCheck out Ringside Wraith, Night Crawler Mirage, Sundown Desperado Bloodhound, and Mic Check Lifeline right now in the Apex store. \n\nGet this drop while it\u2019s hot, because it\u2019s selling out soon.

A simulacrum made from the woman who once was Dr. Ashleigh Reid, Ash is determined to eliminate every trace of weakness that held her back as a human.. Detecting death wherever she goes, spearing enemies with electric snares that lock them in place, tearing through space to take more lives-- it would be easy to think that there was nothing human left within that cold steel.\n\nBut a trace of the human doctor remains, and she poses a greater threat to Ash than any Legend in the ring.\n\n[previewyoutube=CetTZ9cYPd4;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[b]Passive: Marked for Death[/b]\nAsh's map shows the location of recent deathboxes.

Many have tried to make a home here: all have failed. A survey of the area revealed the remains of three unique settlements built across the centuries, but no survivors. The colony lay abandoned, only visited by the occasional pirate or castaway. Now the Mercenary Syndicate has plans of their own for Storm Point.\n\nIt looks so enticing, but the pristine beaches and crystal waters are just the eye of the hurricane. All around, dangers swirl: wild prowlers, venomous spiders, and the gathering storms only add to the tension in the air. Now the Legends are here to make this place their own.\n\nSo it looks like Storm Point is only going to get more dangerous. Check out our blog with all the details [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/stormpoint-map-blog]here[/url].\n\n[h2]BATTLE ROYALE MAP ROTATION[/h2]\nFor the Escape update the map rotation will be back down to 2 maps; Storm Point and World\u2019s Edge. With Storm Point being a whole new map, we want to make sure players have plenty of time to master the new arena.\n\n[h2]ARENAS MAP ROTATION[/h2]\nWith the introduction of Encore, the Arenas map rotation will now include only the custom made Arenas maps. We will not be using BR locations for Arenas in the Escape update.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/51e7d2a69451c9e9b662830de769a2cd7d8dc575.png[/img]\n\n[h2]NEW WEAPON: C.A.R. SMG[/h2]\nWhen you\u2019re in a precarious place, you need a dangerous, flexible weapon: meet the C.A.R. SMG. The Combat Advanced Round submachine gun is a fully automatic weapon that takes adaptability to the next level by accepting either Light or Heavy mags. The C.A.R. hits hard but handles light, this hybrid weapon\u2019s the best of both worlds for when you\u2019re ready to take a stand and become the most dangerous thing on the island.\n\n[h1]RANKED UPDATES[/h1]\nHello, Legends! Let\u2019s take a quick look at how Ranked in Emergence shaped up and review the changes coming in Escape. Ranked continues to attract a large portion of players (around 40% of all playtime!), but this doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look to make improvements.\n\nNote: We fixed an issue where expired skydrive trails remained accessible for longer than they should have. These trails will now expire on the intended seasonal cadence, as mentioned originally in the [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/ranked-series-3-details]Ranked Series 3 post[/url] (trails from Series 1 & 2 are still grandfathered in).\n\n[h2]RANKED BATTLE ROYALE - ESCAPE[/h2]\n\u201cSkill\u201d in Apex can be evaluated in all sorts of ways. It\u2019s the amalgamation of gun skill, movement, positioning, awareness, legend mastery, and prevailing over everyone else as Champion that separates the lowly Bronze from Apex Predators.\n\nWith that in mind, we want to provide more flexibility and nuance to how players can express skill when RP gains are at stake. Before Escape, measurements have been simple and straightforward. We grant RP based on kill points and a placement multiplier. Now, we\u2019re easing back on some RP restrictions to offer other routes to max out kill-related RP in a match. \n\n[b]TL;DR: Just give me the summary...[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Kill RP values now take differences between killer/victim Ranked tiers into account.\n[*] The kill RP cap (as we have traditionally thought about it up to this point) is effectively being raised from six to seven. However, this kill-related RP cap can be reached in different ways, depending on tier differences and placement. Placement is still paramount, and you still must place first to have a chance at max total RP.\n[/list] To expand on the first point, tier differences between the killer and victim will be taken into account when calculating baseline kill point value. For example, if a Plat player kills a Diamond player, that kill counts as 12 instead of 10 RP.\n\nThe maximum kill point RP is 175. Any kill-related RP that exceeds that after placement and tier modifiers are added doesn\u2019t affect total RP.  The final step is to add a flat placement bonus. Enough with the math, let\u2019s explain these changes with an example:\n\n[i][list]\n[*] As a Platinum player, you party up with your Diamond friend and matchmake into a lobby with similarly skilled players. You snag second place, with 6 kills (and/or assists) against Diamond players, and 3 on Plat players.\n[*] Each kill on those Diamond players is worth 12 points instead of the typical 10, because they are one rank tier higher than you. That leaves us with (12 \u00d7 6) + (10 \u00d7 3) = 102 RP.\n[*] Now let\u2019s take placement into account. In second, the per kill bonus is 10, so our 9 kills (including assists) \u00d7 10 = 90 RP.\n[/list][/i]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/36b7d67bb5b8560749d3cfb651abc58f20e66aee.png[/img]\n\nWe\u2019re curious to see how these changes affect the ranked grind. Jump into Storm Point this first split and let us know how they feel. Stay tuned; this is only the start of what we have in store for Ranked improvements.\n\n[h2]RANKED ARENAS - ESCAPE[/h2]\nWe learned a lot from the first season of Ranked arenas and are eager to bring you some improvements:\n[list]\n[*] Arenas Ranked now has 2 splits, similar to Ranked Battle Royale\n[*] Along with each new season and split, there is a soft MMR reset and new placement matches.  New seasons require the usual 10 placement matches while a new split only requires 5 placement matches.\n[*] Improvements have been made to matchmaking for finding similarly skilled teammates.\n[*] Reduced the AP amount gained or lost from MMR differences between teams.\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE:[/b] [i]The final calculated AP amount for a match is a factor of your current AP and MMR.  It\u2019s also influenced by the MMR differences between teams. In practice, this difference was factoring in more than we wanted. I.e. Losing a match you were slightly favored to win was giving a bigger AP loss than desired.[/i]\n\n[h1]PATCH NOTES[/h1]\n[h2]BALANCE CHANGES: LEGENDS[/h2]\n[h3]WATTSON[/h3]\n\nMove aside Ash, this is Wattson\u2019s season. We\u2019re ecstatic to finally share some long-anticipated Wattson improvements! Her win rate and encounter win rate have always been above average. This could be for a multitude of reasons; her defensive playstyle correlates to higher average placements, Wattson mains are diehard loyalists, and her hitbox has been the smallest in the game ever since Lifeline\u2019s adjustment.\n\nRegardless, much of the high-level data that we\u2019ve shared doesn\u2019t match perception. Play a few games as Wattson and you\u2019ll often find yourself wanting more out of her kit. The goal of these changes is to redistribute her invisible power into the parts of her kit that shape the battlefield in a unique way. We wanted to see what changes could spark more consistency and efficacy in her kit, and ideally ground some of the difficulties surrounding the way her abilities work. \n\nWe want to enable more active gameplay from Wattson players by smoothing out the rough edges in placing fences. Responsiveness tweaks, longer range, and faster cooldowns means that Wattson can much more quickly and reliably set up a defensive position, or even use her fences and pylon in the midst of open combat in a pinch.\n\n[b]General[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Improved the reliability and responsiveness of placing Wattson's Tactical and Ultimate in-world objects.\n[*] Wattson can place her Tactical and Ultimate objects on valid surfaces above Wattson's eye level (to a reasonable extent).\n[*] General hitbox size increase, to compensate for the removal of low profile in the Legacy update.\n[/list] [img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/3df2ed217822f9268734cfe6dc3a0614dba96824.png[/img]\n\n[b]Tactical - Perimeter Defense[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Increased damage on crossing a Fence by 33%. (15 to 20)\n[*] Increased debuff duration on crossing a Fence by 100%. (1.5 to 3 seconds)\n[*] Increased the time allowance to be hit again by a subsequent Fence effect by 100%. (0.5 to 1 second).\n[*] Decreased recharge time by 50% (30 to 15 seconds).\n[*] Increased placement range by 50%.\n[*] Decreased the delay between Fences shutting off and reactivating after an ally passes through them by 60%. (1.0 -> 0.4 seconds)\n[*] Wattson now moves at Unarmed-speed while readying/placing Fence nodes.\n[*] Fence nodes can now be placed as soon as the weapon is readied, instead of waiting for the animation to finish.\n[/list] [b]Ultimate - Interception Pylon[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The Pylon output has been significantly reworked:\n[*] Reduced the number of active Pylons Wattson can place from 3 to 1.\n[*] The Pylon now lasts forever (instead of timing out after 90 seconds).\n[*] The Pylon now has a pool of 250 Shields that can be distributed to nearby players, instead of effectively infinite Shields.\n[*] Increased the Pylon shield recharge rate by 150%, and smoothed regen rate. (2/second -> 5/second, or more accurately: 1/0.5 seconds -> 1/0.2 seconds)\n[*] When a Pylon is out of Shields, it no longer recharges players' Shields, but can still zap incoming ordnance.\n[*] Taking damage while regenerating Shields via the Pylon delays continued regeneration by 1 second.\n[*] The UI on the ground and HUD elements now displays the amount of Shields that remain in the Pylon.\n[*] Pinging a friendly Pylon will now display the percentage of Shields remaining in the Pylon.\n[*] Pylon ordnance-zapping has been moderately reworked.\n[*] Ordnance is now zapped when the Pylon detects that it would hit any surface within range and line of sight of the Pylon, instead of being zapped as soon as it comes within range.\n[*] As a part of the changes, current issues where the Pylon doesn't reliably zap ordnance (particularly concerning airstrike abilities, and ordnance that bounced off surfaces near the Pylon) should now be addressed.\n[/list]\n[h2]BALANCE CHANGES: WEAPONS / GEAR[/h2]\n[h3]SUPPLY DROP ROTATION[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] This season the Triple-Take returns to floor loot and taking its place is the G7 Scout. The Scout enters the Supply Drop with its old friend the Double-Tap Trigger equipped.\n[*]Triple Take - now an energy-consuming marksman * Charge time from 0.8 -> 1.1 (pre-crate value)\n[*] Mag increase at all tiers (Base: 18, White: 21, Blue: 24, Purple: 27)\n[*] Ammo consumed per shot increased to 3\n[*] Ammo required per shot increased to 3\n[/list]\n[h3]HOP UPS[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Dual Shell - Each round loaded into the Mastiff or the 30-30 Repeater is doubled.\n[/list]\n[h3]FULLY KITTED ROTATION[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Added: Mastiff 30-30 Repeater, R-301, CAR, Longbow\n[*] Removed: Peacekeeper, Rampage, RE-45, Flatline, and Charge Rifle\n[/list]\n[h3]EVA-8[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fire rate reduced from 2.1 to 2.0\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE: [/b][i]With the reduced bolt scaling we\u2019ve done in previous passes the EVA-8 is still performing ahead of the shotgun pack. Hitting the base fire rate should help balance out our shotgun roster.[/i]\n\n[h3]PEACEKEEPER[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Slightly increased pellet size\n[*] Choke up time reduced from 1.5s to 1.25s\n[*] Choked up shots remain tight for slightly longer when exiting ADS\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE: [/b][i]When the PK came out of the crate we gave it a big sweep of nerfs to make sure the floor PK wasn\u2019t the crate monster we had all grown to know. In this pass, we swung a little hard so we\u2019re giving it a QOL and usability pass this season.[/i]\n\n[h3]LONGBOW[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Damage reduced from 60 to 55\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE:[/b] [i]We\u2019re walking back a recent buff to the Longbow that proved unnecessary. We wanted to give it some love due to all the recent Marksman updates but it seems the Longbow was just fine.[/i]\n\n[h3]L-STAR[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Reduced barrel effectiveness at all rarity tiers\n[*] Significantly reduced projectile collision size\n[*] Damage reduced from 18 to 17\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE: [/b] [i]The L-STAR has been a force to be reckoned with this season so we\u2019re taking a big swing and hitting its projectile size and damage in an effort to bring it down a notch.[/i]\n\n[h3]G7 SCOUT[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Damage increased from 34 to 36\n[*] Double Tap added to Supply Drop G7 Scout\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE:[/b] [i]With the G7 Scout entering the supply drop we\u2019re giving it a bump to damage and adding back on the retired Double Tap to give it some extra spice.[/i]\n\n[h3]SUPPLY DROP WEAPON RATES[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Early game crate weapon rate increased from 25% to 50%\n[*] Mid game crate weapon rate increased from 50% to 75%\n[*] Late game crate weapon rate increased from 75% to 100%\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE:[/b] [i]Pushing a supply drop in the end game and whiffing on a weapon feels pretty rough. We want to improve the reliability of getting crate weapons out of supply drops throughout all phases of the game. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re adjusting Kraber spawn rates accordingly to keep them in line.[/i]\n\n[h3]HOT ZONE GOLD LOOT RATES[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Increased amount of gold loot that spawns in hot zones\n[/list] [b]DEV NOTE: [/b][i]Hot Zones can sometimes feel a bit lackluster so we\u2019re injecting more high-tier loot into these dynamic zones to make them more enticing drop spots.[/i]\n\n[h3]CRAFTING[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Increased ammo from crafting:\n[*] Light Ammo 20 \u2192 60\n[*] Heavy Ammo 20 \u2192 60\n[*] Energy Ammo 20 \u2192 60\n[*] Shotgun Ammo 8 \u2192 24\n[*] Arrows 16 \u2192 48\n[*] Sniper 12 \u2192 36\n[*] Crafting Ammo price increased from 5 to 10 per weapon\n[*] Evo Armor Points from crafting increased from 100 to 150\n[*] Evo Armor Points cost increased from 45 to 50\n[*] Replaced a sniper bundle with a shotgun bundle featuring the Dual Shell\n[/list]\n[h3]ENEMY NPC UPDATES[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Prowler health across the game has gone up from 90 to 114 (Storm Point and World\u2019s Edge)\n[*] Prowlers on World\u2019s Edge and Flyers on Kings Canyon now reward EVO points (25%) ... all damage done to AI now rewards progress to your EVO armor\n[/list]\n[h2]ARENAS[/h2]\n[h3]Supply Drop[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Supply drop will now land outside the first ring, if possible, and land 10 seconds earlier.\n[*] Purple weapons now spawn more in earlier rounds\n[*] Round 1 -

However, with Storm Point, Apex's fourth map that drops with Season 11: Escape, Respawn is confident they have a competitively viable battleground on its hands.</p>\n<p>For a start, Storm Point has been designed by Rodney Reece, who created the competitive scene's current map of choice, World's Edge. While Storm Point is pushing boundaries in terms of its size and introduces a new loot mechanic in the form of wildlife, all of its innovations appear to have been made with considerations of the competitive scene in mind. Speaking to The Loadout, Reece lifts the lid on how some members of the competitive Apex community helped shape the most striking aspect of Storm Point - its verticality.</p>\n<p>\"From a competitive perspective, we knew this could be problematic,\" Reece admits. \"There were a lot of things to solve. So immediately, we did internal play tests, where we bring competitive players in. The main thing that we were looking at at the time were the negative aspects that the competitive community didn't like about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/storm-point-competitive\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/crossplay\">Apex Legends crossplay: how to play with friends across platforms</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked: ranks, splits, and Season 11 scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 11</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1635519951, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4186652357025670392", "title": "\u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0433 \u0438\u0437 Titanfall: \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 11-\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0435 Apex Legends", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4186652357025670392", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0421\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News161158/5ea367297c-1_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0443 11-\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430 \"<strong>\u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0433</strong>\". \u041f\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f <strong>GameMAG.ru</strong>.\u00a0</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1635463860, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4186652357025050892", "title": "Apex Legends Season 11 changes ranked RP scoring system", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4186652357025050892", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apex-legends-ranked-rp-changes-season-11-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends' ranked mode</a> is getting a bit of a shakeup in Season 11: Escape. As well as allowing players to dive straight into new map Storm Point in the first split of the season, players will have a revised ranked battle royale scoring system to get their heads around too.</p>\n<p>While the base principle remains the same - kills, placement bonuses, and placement scores all combine to give you an end RP score - the maths is changing somewhat for ranked Season 11. While placement points will all stay the same, Respawn is relaxing the rules on RP earned through kills and assists. Say goodbye to the six-kill cut off for RP, and say hello to a more dynamic scoring system.</p>\n<p>So how does it work? Well, for a start, the amount of RP you earn for each kill or assist will now scale depending on the rank of the opponent. If you're a Platinum-ranked player and kill a Diamond player, you will receive 12 RP, rather than the standard 10 RP. This also scales down too, so if you're a Gold player killing a Silver player, you will earn only 8 RP.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-rp-changes-season-11\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/crossplay\">Apex Legends crossplay: how to play with friends across platforms</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked: ranks, splits, and Season 11 scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 11</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1635447788, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4186652357025050921", "title": "Apex Legends' Storm Point designer on why it's the biggest and tallest map yet", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4186652357025050921", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apex-legends-storm-point-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Storm Point, the new Apex Legends map coming to the battle royale in Season 11: Escape, looks to stretch the limits of level design beyond Apex's previous three maps. Storm Point is the biggest and tallest map in the game - it's 15% larger than previous record holder World's Edge, and at its peak, it rises higher than the plane in Kings Canyon.</p>\n<p>But was this always the goal from the start of Storm Point's development, or did the geographical extremities occur naturally throughout the two-year development process? Rodney Reece, the lead level designer for Storm Point (and the brain behind World's Edge too) says that from the outset he wanted the fourth map to push boundaries.</p>\n<p>Speaking to The Loadout, Reece explains that he pushed for so much verticality because he knew at the start of development that the game would eventually have legends with movement-specific abilities. He says the kits of Season 9's Valkyrie and latest legend Ash were perfect fits for Storm Point's dizzying heights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/storm-point-biggest-map\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/crossplay\">Apex Legends crossplay: how to play with friends across platforms</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked: ranks, splits, and Season 11 scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 11</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1635447491, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4186652357024656021", "title": "Apex Legends' new hero Ash hunts squads with Titanfall-inspired abilities", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4186652357024656021", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-escape5.png/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-escape5.png\" /> <p>\n<a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' next season, Escape, kicks off next week, and it introduces the new playable character Ash.

As an island it of course has lovely coastal beaches around its perimeter, alongside large rocky outcroppings that cover the majority of the island.

Good teamwork and strategy are key if you want to succeed in this arena.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/f9f36f71e2bd403bf404476ba51ed1a028793ecc.png[/img]\n\nThe layout offers combat over two high-ground power positions. On one side we have a VIP Lounge. The lounge platform provides direct combat. Flank options in the interior sections bring good clutch opportunities and strategic ways to dominate the fights.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/10ee2d6c413f4024c60d57a5492a525f24abc6ab.png[/img]\n\nAcross the VIP Lounge is the Performance Stage. Establishing control there depends heavily on support fire from your teammates. The flanks on top of the seat ramps are wide and exposed. The middle of Encore is devoid of high ground positions and separates the stage and the lounge platform.\n\n[h2]SHADOW ROYALE[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/72278b218fea6bb3803721d7108a7ac8becbb4c1.png[/img]\n\nThe last week of this event features the return of fan-favorite Shadow Royale. Take part in a darker version of the Apex Games, overseen by Revenant with a horrifying twist. All slain Legends respawn in a Shadow-Form to exact revenge and help their living squadmates.

This POI is big enough to accommodate a few teams fighting over the shop itself, and she\u2019s also built a wonderful paintball course out front that acts as a spill off location if the drop just looks too spicy.\n\nInside the shop, you can use collected materials to purchase Rampart\u2019s Custom Modded Paintball Weapons from the new Vend-it Machines. These guns cost a bit, but they come fully kitted at different tiers. This should give players a reason to rotate here mid-game if their weapons just aren\u2019t as upgraded as they\u2019d like.\n\nAs usual, be on the lookout for extra lore sprinkled around.

Her special deals update frequently, so be sure to check what\u2019s available in your match and plan accordingly.\n\n[h1]Rampart\u2019s Heirloom: Problem Solver[/h1]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/314545cc6eac066c059afb42fba94404913b2b6f.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b948d2b296e590d23545c1f514fee0a603f0be56.jpg[/img]\n\nWhile the brick-and-mortar location might be in Battle Royale, Rampart\u2019s bringing her entrepreneurship into the Arenas too in \u201cRampart\u2019s Arenas Extravaganza,\u201d with special discounts meant to inspire players to change up their usual loadouts. For all of her hard work, Rampart\u2019s getting a \u201cProblem Solver:\u201d a brand-new Heirloom pipe wrench, complete with a gumball dispenser. Who could ask for anything more? Oh, well - how about an upgrade to Sheila?\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/6f6dc3ec4c430bd0fc1a4650088ab1eff901d9fb.jpg[/img]\n\nFinally, unlock event-limited cosmetics for Wraith, Octane, Pathfinder, Fuse, Bangalore, Rampart, and Lifeline that give a glimpse into what our Legends could become with time and technology on their side.\n\n[h1]BALANCE CHANGES[/h1]\n\n[h3]Rampart[/h3]\n[b]Sheila has gone mobile![/b]\n[list]\n[*] Rampart will now be able to run around with Sheila out, and shoot while walking. The spin up is longer, and she only gets 1 magazine in this mode.\n[*] Once Sheila is out, you can put it away and pull it back out until you run out of ammo (or hit the cooldown time). \n[*] At any point, you can still place Sheila down for your teammates to use. Once placed, it has infinite reloads and acts just like the previous version. You cannot pick it back up.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: A legend based solely on a defensive position is hard to get right in Apex Legends. We think Rampart has a place as the ultimate defensive Legend, but we wanted to give her a little more ability to be reactive and push with her team. As usual, we\u2019ll be watching to see how this plays out and will adjust accordingly![/i]\n\n[h3]Revenant[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] VFX (similar to the pulse on Loba ult placement) added to increase visibility for when a totem is placed nearby.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Octane[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Reduced jump pad horizontal distance by 10% - 15%.\n[*] Reduced the rate of Octane\u2019s Stim regen from 1.5 to 1.0 hp/sec.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Bloodhound[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] When Bloodhound pings a clue from their passive, it will now show their teammates in quickchat how long ago the event took place\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Bocek Compound Bow[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Draw speed slightly reduced from 0.56 to 0.54\n[*] Arrows per brick increased from 14 to 16\n[*] Arrows per inventory stack increased from 28 to 32\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Hemlok[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Reduced hipfire spread\n[*] Hipfire resets slightly faster\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes: The Hemlok\u2019s hipfire effectiveness was reduced a few seasons ago and since then the weapon has seen a steady decline in use. Bringing back some of that hipfire strength (but not all) should help the weapon feel more consistent in close quarters without being dominant or affecting its medium-range excellence.[/i]\n\n[h3]Shatter Caps - Bocek Compound Bow[/h3]\n[list]\n[b]Damage per pellet increased across all draw strengths[/b]\n[*] Short draw damage: 4 to 6\n[*] Medium draw: 7 to 9\n[*] Full draw: 11 to 12\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Shatter Caps - 30-30 Repeater[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] ADS Strafe speed increased to shotgun strafe speed while Shatter Caps are enabled\n[*] Charged pellet damage multiplier increased from 35% to 50%\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes: When Shatter Caps work they feel amazing, but currently it can still feel a little punishing to swap into the mode. Increasing the damage potential and improving the CQC flow of the 30-30 should help Shatters feel a little more accessible and rewarding.[/i]\n\n[h3]L-STAR[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Cool-off time slightly increased\n[*] Overheat lens replacement time slightly increased\n[*] Rounds before overheat reduced at base and all Energy Magazine tiers\n[/list]\n - Base: 22 to 20\n - White: 24 to 22\n - Blue: 26 to 24\n - Purple/Gold: 28 to 26\n[list]\n[*] Arenas price adjustments:\n[/list]\n - Base: 500 to 600\n - Blue: 300 to 250\n - Purple: 400 to 350\n\n[i]Dev Notes: We\u2019re nudging down the L-STAR\u2019s core stats a bit to smooth out the power progression in what we think is a slightly more healthy top-end. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on the L-STAR and it\u2019s recoil as we enter the second half of Emergence. In Arenas, we\u2019re well aware of it\u2019s prevalence in high-level lobbies and are pricing it out of the first round. These changes essentially increase the blue cost by 50 and keep the purple price the same. If its pick rate remains unchanged, we will hotfix further adjustments.[/i]\n\n[h3]Shotguns[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] EVA-8 and Mozambique headshot damage multiplier reduced from 1.5 to 1.25 bringing it in line with the Peacekeeper and Mastiff.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes: The EVA-8 holds a lot of power in its speed and leniency compared to its counterparts, the PK and Mastiff. It\u2019s got the edge with fire rate and consistency so we\u2019re shaving off some of its spike damage to even the playing field. We\u2019re normalizing the Mozambique as well for consistency within the shotgun class and to give the P2020 some space as the more precise early game weapon.[/i]\n\n[h3]Triple Take[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] ADS charge time decreased from 1.0 to 0.8\n[/list]\n\n[h1]QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Shortened the out-of-bounds timer from 30 seconds to 15.\n[/list]\n - Your timer should be reset after being respawned.\n\n[list]\n[*] Swapping from Red to a Gold Shield with more health no longer requires a long press.\n[*] Evo Shields in deathboxes now show their health.\n[*] \n[/list]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/70cb7bce408fc112b9bb2e71b554de162401813a.png[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Early Leaver Warning has been improved to help people from accidentally leaving before their party is dead.\n[/list]\n - You now need to hold the confirm button down for a small amount of time\n - The highlighting is different colored than other prompts to catch your attention\n - Red text warning showing your leaving penalty added\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c0199c58d0420e1dec8915d0537fe9fedba2f1c0.jpg[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Added character portraits to \"detected\" widget for recon characters.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]BUG FIXES[/h1]\n\n[h3]UI[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a bug where Streamer mode wouldn\u2019t anonymize the names on the scoreboard in Arenas mode\n[*] Fixed issue for when players would randomly get un-readied while matchmaking in Ranked.\n[*] Fix for Ranked Arenas: longest win streak number was incorrect for some players when viewed in the Stats screen.\n[*] Fixed cases where players would still see Ranked icons when switching over to Arenas while inspecting personal stats. \n[*] Fix for cases where the player would still see the Abandon Penalty countdown when getting other messages like RECEIVED PREMIUM CURRENCY.\n[*] Removed the red speaker icon that would show up on the upper right corner of the screen that served no purpose.\n[*] Fix for when the Playlist Selector would sometimes flicker.\n[*] Players should no longer encounter a string issue in the Timeline when they have a \";\" in their username.\n[*] Fixed cases where the name of killed players was not always showing up when a player died.\n[*] Fixed a rare bug that can cause the Observer to get stuck on the Intro Screen at the start of a match.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Fuse[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Motherload ultimate will no longer highlight enemies far below the ring. \n[/list]\n\n[h3]Seer[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Increased the hitbox for Exhibit Ultimate to better match the model.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Loba[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Loba can no longer glitch into Skyhook when using her tactical.\n[*] Fix cases for when Loba\u2019s ultimate visualfx do not appear while aiming down sites.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Rampart[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed bug that could get players stuck under the map after dismounting from Ramparts Turret on a Trident.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Bangalore[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fix for the times when pinging a Prowler would trigger a voice line that mentions a removed hop-up.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Gibraltar[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fix for cases where it appeared that Gibraltar's Ultimate caused dropped audio.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Wattson[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a bug where Wattson would start matches with 30 fences.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Valkyrie[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an exploit where players could get continuous missiles after exploiting Valkyrie's passive/tactical as well as use the Vtol jets infinitely.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Sentinel[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fix for when players would still see \"Amped\" or \"Revved up\" from Sentinel or Rampage after swapping weapons.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Wingman[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fix for reactive skins, \u201cPrecision Calibur\u201d and \u201cAttention to Detail\u201d where part of the skins appeared stuck in place when shooting.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]World\u2019s Edge[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Various fixes on World\u2019s Edge cleaning up some bad collisions, exploitable hiding spots, and areas where players could get stuck.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Firing Range[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fix for the mysterious fire show that could appear in Firing Range and cause a crash.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]MISC[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fix for cases where players were able to reach farther than intended when punching an enemy player.\n[*] Private Match Fix - Observers should no longer get stuck on the intro screen for the duration of the match.\n[*] Fix for Audio fluttering that could happen when killing someone during self-revive.\n[*] Various fixes to improve overall game stability.\n[*] (PC only) You\u2019ll no longer be able to bind forward movement to the Mouse wheel on PC.

We weigh every change to these systems carefully and value feedback.\n\nAfter further testing, we've concluded we need to take more time to get this right to make sure related movement mechanics aren't caught in the cross-fire.\n__\n\n\nEarlier this week, we announced our intention to \u201cremove tap-strafing,\u201d a decision that was met with surprise by many movement enthusiasts. Tap-strafing is a term associated with different sorts of movement, depending on who you ask. Internally, we generally use it to describe what many associate with scroll-wheel strafing. \n\nTo be more explicit, this change targets multiple rapid directional commands after jumping. Movement should feel unchanged for controllers and for M&K (mouse-and-keyboard) players who hadn\u2019t heard of the term \u201ctap-strafe\u201d until this week. [b]Thanks to the work of a couple of our engineers, this is now easily tunable on the fly, and we have the ability to iterate on or even revert it completely without a client update.[/b]\n\nOur goal is to remove some of the sharpness in momentum conservation around 90\u00b0+ angles. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of when I use the term \u201ctap-strafe\u201d throughout this post. Things like wall-bounce redirects back onto that same wall should feel unchanged, but movement afforded by scroll-wheel strafing will be removed.\n\nSince tap-strafing is a unique M&K mechanic, many platforms have asked about our approach to controller-specific systems like aim assist. As Apex and its players evolve, it\u2019s only prudent for us to continue to evaluate whether or not aim assist needs adjustment.  When top-level controller players say they would be alright with nerfing aim assist, we definitely take note. Players should not feel forced to use a specific input type to stay competitive\n\nWhen people say, \u201cGee dang it, Respawn\u2019s balancing decisions cater to controller players,\u201d the best answer I have is: \u201cWhen it comes to accessibility, we often must consider controller players given the constraints compared to M&K. But, accessibility isn\u2019t the same as balance design, and it\u2019s a strawman argument to treat it as such.\u201d\n\nThis is why we believe tap-strafing exists solely as a design problem. Even in a M&K-only Apex world, or a scenario where controller and M&K could tap-strafe just the same, we don\u2019t believe it would be a healthy change with the freedom it currently allows, for three main reasons:\n\n[b]The first issue: it\u2019s highly inaccessible.[/b] By \u201cinaccessible,\u201d we mean that it\u2019s an opaque technique that\u2019s practically impossible to learn organically (and the most egregious examples require a strange keybind). \n\n[b]Secondly, tap-strafes have terrible readability and limited counter play.[/b] Path grapples and Octane pads aside, I\u2019ve seen clips of players breaking ankles with victims (including high-skill players) who are at a loss for what to do. While it\u2019s not terribly prevalent, I\u2019m concerned about how this could continue to evolve as more players adapt and further develop their tap-strafe mechanics.\n\n[b]The third point, and the most problematic, is how tap-strafing is exacerbated by movement abilities.[/b] I can buy that a tap-strafe at normal velocity in a gunfight occurs infrequently and is relatively mild enough to not immediately kill with fire. But Path grappling past and tap-strafing back into your face with a Mastiff, or Octane cranking 90s while maintaining ridiculous speed both bring up greater gameplay concerns.\n\nMobility creep is something to be very mindful of in this game. While many love the freedom that Apex\u2019s movement system affords, constraints are just as important. It\u2019s not surprising that mobility legends are highly popular. Why don\u2019t we just do more of that? Well, over time (and I\u2019d say we are already seeing it) mobility creep can open up a Pandora's box of new problems to solve. How is third partying affected by mobility? Within a fight, how are frontlines defined? How quickly can I close the gap on an enemy? As a game, Apex is designed to work well with a finite number of movement possibilities.\n\nI feel it\u2019s important to note that limitations don\u2019t always equate to lowering skill-gaps; there are skill-gaps in working within constraints. One could argue that bunny-hop healing lowered the skill-ceiling\u2014players could make up for misplays with less constraints on their ability to safely heal. Different types of skill expression are changed when we touch something like perfect air control, for better or for worse.\n\nHopefully this provided some context, and as always, we\u2019re happy to hear your thoughts.\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1631652896, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4020014731812614899", "title": "Apex Legends will keep tap-strafing, at least for now", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4020014731812614899", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends_C7972ZW.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-legends_C7972ZW.jpg\" /> <p>\nA couple of weeks ago, Respawn Entertainment said they were going to get rid of tap-strafing in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>, but now it seems they've changed their minds.

Well, first you have to pop your ultimate and hover the placement indicator over an eligible spot (i.e. within the 100 metre limit). Then, cancel your ultimate, and begin running further away from that point in a straight line. Be sure that you can still see the spot where you had your placement indicator and that there isn't anything obstructing your line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pathfinder-zipline-bug-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tap-strafing-patch-delayed\">Apex Legends tap-strafing removal pushed back for further testing</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in Season 10</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series/commissioner-year-2-launch\">Apex Legends Global Series prepares to kick off for Year 2</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1631102966, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4020014099090754559", "title": "Claim your Sarge Weapon Charm with EA Play*", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4020014099090754559", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Electronic Arts", "contents": "Launch Apex Legends from Sept 2\u2013Oct 4.

At first glance, it would seem the folks participating in the Apex hack were the good guys who only turned to hacking to trying to raise awareness of their troubles. Nope. It turns out the very same group behind the Apex attack are allegedly the cause of Titanfall's issues too, and it's apparently all part of a messy plot to revive the cancelled spin-off, Titanfall Online. \n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-and-titanfall-hackers-caught-in-elaborate-plot-to-revive-titanfall-online\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Rock, Paper, Shotgun", "date": 1628514681, "feedname": "Rock, Paper, Shotgun", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4032396530955219892", "title": "Apex Legends cross-progression is still coming, but it's \"gnarly as hell\" to solve", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4032396530955219892", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apex-legends-cross-play-update-900x506.jpeg\"/><p>Quite a while ago, Respawn announced it had plans for both <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/crossplay\">Apex Legends cross-play</a> and cross-progression in the works.

You begin your journey through Ranked Arenas in 10 placement matches where your performance will determine your initial Match Marking Rank (MMR) and your starting rank. MMR variance is wider initially, so your first 10 matches might be stomp-or-get-stomped until your MMR defines your placement.\n\nArenas is a head-to-head fight between two teams of three, so awarding Ranked Arenas Points is more cut-and-dry than in the 20 team Battle Royale. This means there is no entry cost and no AP for kills. Everything comes down to getting the win. \n\nThat\u2019s just the high level of how ranked arenas work.

We identified two opportunities to help him that weren't just \"give him more damage.\u201d We believe Apex is a gun game first and foremost and therefore want to make sure we don't put too much damage into character abilities.\n\nThe first opportunity we identified was his tactical. While meant as a persistent area denial tool, it currently does not last long enough to seriously inconvenience an enemy. We doubled the duration so you can now place one at a door and be reasonably sure no one's coming through that door for a little while. While we doubled the duration, the damage per second remains the same. Please don\u2019t stand in the fire.\n\nSecondly, his ultimate often didn't give his team an advantage; sure, you may catch enemies within it, but the flames made it impossible for you to step inside, and you couldn't see the enemies you trapped either because the flames were in the way. We explored a few ways to deal with this but ended up going for the most straight-forward answer: you get enemy outlines as long as they stay inside the ring of fire.[/i]\n\n[h2]HORIZON[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Reduced the slow after the initial Black Hole pull.\n[*] Bumped Horizon gravity lift-up speed to a happy medium between 9.1 and Legacy update launch values. \n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev note: There\u2019s no doubt the nerfs Horizon received with Legacy were necessary, but given the benefit of time and hindsight we decided we probably hit the speed of her tactical too hard. Instead of completely reverting that part of the nerf, we found a happy medium between how fast her gravity lift operated at release and how slow it was after the nerf. This one's hard to communicate with numbers, so just give her a try and tell us what you think.[/i]\n\n[h2]REVENANT[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] There\u2019s now a visual and audio cue when Death Totem protection is about to end which can be seen/heard by other players.\n[*] Added a brief slow after being recalled to Death Totem.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]CAUSTIC[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Gas damage starts at 5, increases by 1 every other tick indefinitely.\n[*] Cooldown on Tactical has been reduced 25s -> 20s.\n[*] Ultimate cooldown has been reduced 3.5m -> 3m. Duration reduced from 20s -> 15s.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev note:\n\nCaustic is a dangerous character to buff. Push him a little too far, and he quickly takes over the meta. Constantly fighting through gas is no fun, so we definitely want to avoid him becoming dominant once more. That said, we're now convinced the nerf that dropped his gas damage to a flat 5 damage went too far. When you can sit in gas and take a syringe or two and be fine, gas is not a scary enough deterrent. So we switched back to a scaling model. This time we decided to let the damage scale a little more slowly. Instead of going up by one every tick, we're increasing it by one every other tick. Damage is uncapped at the top here, but really that's very theoretical. Enemies will generally be dead around the time the gas reaches 11 damage per tick (unless you've been healing). The desired effect here is to make enemies feel a great urgency to leave the gas as soon as possible.\n\nAt the same time, we wanted to be mindful specifically of Caustic's impact in late game circles at the highest level. Even with Ring 6 now slowly closing over 100 seconds, we were worried about the effect that a single Caustic ult could have in the late game. We reduced its duration by 5 seconds. The ult represents Caustic's highest moment of power; his enemies have no way of countering it. 15 seconds is still a meaningful amount of time (and with the damage changes, 15s is long enough to kill someone) but it should hopefully make fighting a Caustic in the end game slightly less frustrating.[/i]\n\n[h1]WEAPON META[/h1]\n\n[h2]SUPPLY DROP ROTATION[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d3f271ceb73c67ff00fd1c508b9c0ce826a90a8f.jpg[/img]\n\nThis season the [b]Prowler [/b]returns to floor loot and taking its place is the [b]M600 Spitfire[/b].

This hop up will be equipable to the Hemlok Burst AR and the Wingman.\n[*] To make room, the Anvil Receiver and Quickdraw Holster are being vaulted for now.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]FULLY KITTED ROTATION[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/23a73181f7815b46568d996cb32e4404041c02ca.jpg[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Added: Peacekeeper, Rampage, RE-45, Flatline, and Charge Rifle\n[*] Removed: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel\n[/list]\n\n[h2]MAGAZINE ATTACHMENTS[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Reload speed increase associated with magazines has been moved to the equivalent stock rarity tier.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note \n\nMagazines are the most potent source of lootable power for most weapons and that largely comes in the form of ammo capacity. In addition to capacity, they were also offering increased reload speed. We\u2019ve moved the reload speed buff to stocks to help increase the value of stocks and spread out our meaningful modifiers across our attachments.[/i]\n\n[h2]STOCK ATTACHMENTS[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] All stocks now offer increased reload speed (instead of magazines)\n[*] Marksman Weapons (30-30 Repeater, G7 Scout, Triple-Take) now take Sniper Stocks instead of Tactical Stocks\n[*] Sniper Stocks on Marksman weapons will offer increased stability and sway reduction with slightly reduced handling bonuses (from tactical stocks)\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nSniper stocks are an often lonely attachment left sitting on the floor waiting for a crackshot legend to come along and give them some love. Instead of reducing the spawn rates to try and clean up the loot pool we\u2019re putting them on Marksman Rifles to make them more desirable.[/i]\n\n[h2]L-STAR[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Now takes Energy Magazines\u2014Mags on the L-STAR work differently than other weapons because of its unique interaction with ammo. Instead they will allow the L-STAR to fire more shots before it overheats and allow it to cool-off its heat build up slightly faster.\n[*] Now take Barrels for recoil reduction\n[*] Projectile VFX scale reduced by roughly half\n[*] First-Person on-hit impact effect intensity reduced \n[*] Hipfire spread increased\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nThe L-STAR has undergone a few changes in Emergence. We\u2019ve attempted to improve the looting experience and extend the L-STAR\u2019s power into the later phases of the game. In addition to these attachment additions the L-STAR is also seeing some VFX changes for combat readability.[/i]\n\n[h2]LIGHT MACHINE GUNS[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Reduced the headshot multiplier for all LMGs from 2.0 to 1.75\n[*] Increased the limbshot multiplier for all LMGs from 0.75 to 0.85\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nLMG spray-and-pray was feeling a little too oppressive when random headshots chunked with a 2.0 damage modifier. We\u2019re shaving off some of that headshot firepower but adding a little back in by bringing up their limb damage. Unloading massive LMG mags to suppress your enemies should still be a valid tactic, we\u2019re just reigning in the peaks and valleys to make it feel a bit more consistent.[/i]\n\n[h2]PISTOLS[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Reduced handling time for all pistols by ~10%\n[*] Raise, Holster, Zoom In/Out time\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nWith the removal of the Quickdraw Holster and reload speed moving from mags to stocks Pistols took a bit of a hit. We\u2019re increasing their base handling but will keep an eye on their performance as we get into Emergence.[/i]\n\n[h2]PROWLER BURST PDW[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Time Between Burst increased from 0.2 to .24 \n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nThe Prowler returns to the floor without its trusty side-kick the Select Fire hop up. But don\u2019t sleep on it, it's still a beast.[/i]\n\n[h2]M600 SPITFIRE[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Damage increased from 18 to 19\n[*] Hip Fire Spread back to season 8 pre-nerf values \n[*] Purple Mag Size increased from 50 to 55 \n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nWe\u2019ve all woken up with a cold sweat in the middle of the night from a nightmare where Rampart with two gold mag spittys chases you on the World\u2019s Edge train tracks laughing maniacally as she shoots for eternity, right?  \u2026 right? Well for those of us that have, we\u2019ll be able to sleep soundly for a while. The Spitfire takes its rightful place as a Supply Drop weapon this season. We\u2019ve hit it a few times in recent patches and we still want it to be a desirable Supply Drop weapon so we\u2019re walking back those nerfs while making it much harder to access.[/i]\n\n[h2]ALTERNATOR[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Reintroducing the Disruptor Rounds which come equipped on a Supply Drop Alternator\n[*] Disruptor Rounds - Increase shield damage by 40%\n[*] Disruptor Rounds can ONLY be found on Alternators from the Supply Drop\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nThe Alternator joins the Spitfire in the Supply Drop with its old friend the Disruptor Rounds. The shield damage has come down since we last saw Disruptors in Season 2, but it\u2019s still a shield shredding monster. Pack an extra bat.[/i]\n\n[h2]30-30 REPEATER[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Reload speed from stocks is increased.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nThe 30-30 can slap, but when it's not slapping it\u2019s probably reloading. We\u2019re buffing the 30-30\u2019s bonus to reload speed from stocks to help alleviate one of the sharper pain points when running this heavy rifle.[/i]\n\n[h2]EVA-8[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Significantly reduced bolt fire-rate scaling for each rarity tier\n[*] Base fire-rate remains unchanged\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note\n\nThe EVA-8\u2019s speed makes it a forgiving and formidable shotgun to run. It\u2019s pulled ahead of the pack and has been seen as the clear choice for many leaving the Peacekeeper, Mastiff, and Mozambique in the dust. This change should help even the playing field between the shotguns.[/i]\n\n[h2]ARENAS WEAPON UPDATES[/h2]\n\nCare package changes apply to arenas: the Prowler and Rampage replace the Alternator and Spitfire in the Arenas shop.\n\n[b]Prowler[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 450\n[*] Lvl 1: 200\n[*] Lvl 2: 300\n[*] Lvl 3: 400\n[/list]\n\n[b]Rampage[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 500\n[*] Lvl 1: 200\n[*] Lvl 2: 300\n[*] Lvl 3: 350\n[/list]\n\n[h2]ARENAS PRICE ADJUSTMENTS[/h2]\n\n[b]L-STAR[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Lvl 1: 100 -> 150\n[*] Lvl 2: 200 -> 250\n[*] Lvl 3: 300 -> 350\n[/list]\n\n[b]30-30 Repeater[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Lvl 1: 200 -> 150\n[/list]\n\n[b]Bocek Bow[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 600 -> 500\n[/list]\n\n[b]Charge Rifle[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 700 -> 600\n[*] Lvl 1: 250 -> 200\n[*] Lvl 2: 300 -> 200\n[*] Lvl 3: 400 -> 450\n[/list]\n\n[b]EVA-8[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 300 -> 350\n[/list]\n\n[b]Mastiff[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 400 -> 350\n[/list]\n\n[b]Peacekeeper[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Base: 500 -> 350\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fuse[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Knuckle Cluster: 75 -> 100\n[/list]\n\n[h2]ARENAS ABILITY ADJUSTMENTS[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Horizon's [/b]Gravity Lift starting charges reduced from 2 to 1\n[*] [b]Mirage's [/b]Psyche Out starting charges reduced from 3 to 2\n[*] [b]Bloodhound's[/b] free scans while in Beast of the Hunt reduced from 3 to 2\n[/list]\n\n[h1]BUG FIXES[/h1]\n\n[b]Bloodhound[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue where Bloodhound's tactical failed to highlight the enemy for the Bloodhound player while they used an emote.\n[*] Trident and Dropship audio should no longer be significantly dampened when Bloodhound is using their Ultimate.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Gibraltar[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Corrected an audio issue with Gibraltars Dome Shield failing to make sound.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Lifeline[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed cases where Lifeline\u2019s VO still says \"I've got you. Shields up\" even when she no longer has a shield.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Pathfinder[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Pathfinder's Grapple no longer stays connected when he\u2019s killed while under Revenant\u2019s Death Protection.\n[*] Updated Pathfinder \"Copper Core\" legs so they now match in first-person view.\n[*] Fixed an issue where Pathfinder\u2019s Grapple cooldown audio cue replayed rapidly after deploying tactical in gameplay.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Wraith[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Wraith can no longer use her ultimate while attached to Valkyrie\u2019s ultimate.\n[*] Fixed a rare bug which allowed downed players to jump/bunny-hop after entering a Wraith Portal that was placed by a crouching Wraith.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Bangalore\n[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue causing Bangalore's Smoke Launcher to disappear when moving away from other players with certain Legendary skins equipped.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Caustic[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a bug that allowed Caustic Barrels to be pushed into players, crushing them.\n[*] Fuse\u2019s Ultimate \"Motherlode\" is no longer destroyed if it interacts with Caustic gas.\n[*] Wattson\u2019s ult will no longer shoot down friendly Caustic barrels and ults.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Mirage[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Addressed an issue where Mirage's invisible revive wouldn\u2019t fully cloak teammates when certain skins were being worn.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Octane[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an exploit that allowed players to wedge an Octane jump pad between a supply bin to make the Trident faster.\n[*] Fixed a visual bug where Octane's goggles moved independently after using his tactical.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Wattson[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Removed the beam of light that shoots into the sky every time Wattson places down her fence.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Crypto[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Arenas: Fixed a bug where Crypto\u2019s Drone could be deployed and recalled infinite times when the user had only one charge available.\n[*] Switch Only: Fixed a visual bug where Crypto's position indicator while in his drone flickered near the top and left edge of the screen.\n[*] Switch Only: The UI for Crypto\u2019s tactical charges should no longer overlap with the recharging UI when his drone is destroyed in Arenas.\n[*] Fixed a bug that prevented the Drone from being able to detect enemies using Trident.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Revenant[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a visual bug when the Heirloom appears to be floating in third-person when looking up and down inside the Gravity Lift.\n[*] Placing a Death Totem too close to the edge of the map should no longer teleport players off the map when returning to the totem.\n[*] Emote fix: Added the missing Silence Orb to Revenant's \"Suffering Silence\" emote.\n[*] Fixed some exploitable hiding spots reachable in Rift using Revenant.\n[*] Fixed some cases when Revenant didn\u2019t have horizontal movement animations when holding the

Apex Legends Global Series introduces a radically different format as the competition steadily emerges out of the online-only realm. With <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series/year-2-lan-events\">international LAN events on the cards</a>, and an expanded pool of competitive players now that console gamers can compete alongside their PC counterparts, there was certainly a need for a format revamp.</p>\n<p>The main point of change is the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-year-2\">new two-tiered system</a>, which creates a Pro League for the game's very best teams, and a Challenger Circuit where amateur teams or young prospects can compete and vie for the chance to reach the Pro League or be picked up by a top team.</p>\n<p>In an interview with The Loadout following the ALGS Year 2 announcement last week, John Nelson, commissioner of the competition, explains that having a two-tiered approach to competitive Apex, where there is clear separation between great teams and excellent teams, is an important step forward for the scene.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-longer-format\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/13-million-players-season-9\">EA says Apex Legends averaged 13 million weekly players during Season 9</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 10</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/seer-idle-animation-mrvn\">Apex Legends MRVN turns out to be a Seer stan</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1627471772, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4038024692305360421", "title": "ALGS commissioner John Nelson answers ten quick questions about Year 2", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4038024692305360421", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apex-legends-bloodhound-trials-900x506.jpg\"/><p>For fans of competitive Apex Legends, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-year-2\">last week's announcement</a> about Year 2 of the Apex Legends Global Series certainly sparked some conversation. With the competition expanding to include new territories and Xbox and PlayStation console players, a new two-tiered format with LAN events thrown in, and a huge $5 million prize pool, there are big changes on the way.</p>\n<p>Following the announcement, The Loadout spoke to the ALGS' commissioner, John Nelson, to learn more about the massive shakeup to Apex esports. During our conversation, we posed Nelson ten quick questions about Year 2 of the ALGS, focused on aspects that were either unclear or left out of the initial announcement post.</p>\n<p>We've already learned that the ALGS wants its three LANs in Year 2 to be <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series/year-2-lan-events\">hosted across three different continents</a>. So are there any other surprises Nelson has up his sleeve that fans may not yet be aware of?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series/commissioner-year-2-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/13-million-players-season-9\">EA says Apex Legends averaged 13 million weekly players during Season 9</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 10</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/seer-idle-animation-mrvn\">Apex Legends MRVN turns out to be a Seer stan</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1627416521, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4038024692304740872", "title": "Apex Legends' Caustic and Fuse getting buffs in Emergence patch", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/4038024692304740872", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2021/articles/2021-07-27-15-04/apex-legends-caustic-and-fuse-are-getting-buffs-in-emergence-patch-1627394687357.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/90/format/jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>We've already heard a little about <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-22-new-apex-legend-seer-is-all-about-tracking-enemies\">new Apex Legend Seer's abilities</a>, but some existing characters are also getting a rejig in upcoming season Emergence, with both Caustic and Fuse due to get some buffs. </p><p>As explained by <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-emergence-start-date-seers-abilities-worlds-edge-changes-and-everything-we-know/1100-6494395/\">Gamespot</a>, Caustic's gas will no longer deal a flat five ticks of damage per second. Instead, it will increase in damage every other second: for instance, causing 5,5,6,6,7,7 points of damage, with no limit on how much it can increase. Balancing this out, however, the gas cloud created by Caustic's Nox Gas Grenade will disappear five seconds faster. </p><p>Fuse is getting some even more significant (and much-needed) improvements, with his Knuckle Cluster lasting twice as long, and his Motherlode ability now highlighting enemies.

Arguably the most exciting part of the announcement, however, was the plan to return to LAN events.</p>\n<p>With players and fans alike being starved of offline Apex action for almost two years now due to the effects of the pandemic, the news that international LANs could be making a comeback \"should conditions allow\" was well-received. For the competition's commissioner, John Nelson, the return to LAN is also the thing he is looking most forward to - especially as it presents the opportunity to turn Year 1's regional storylines into global ones.</p>\n<p>\"It's been really fun to see so many different countries represented by players and competing against each other, and that obviously goes up a notch when you go to a global event,\" Nelson tells The Loadout. \"A lot of us in the community look back at the Preseason Invitational in September 2019 and think about all those teams that were on Match Point, going into the final game; teams from so many different places of the world. I'm so looking forward to experiencing that again.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series/year-2-lan-events\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/13-million-players-season-9\">EA says Apex Legends averaged 13 million weekly players during Season 9</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 10</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/seer-idle-animation-mrvn\">Apex Legends MRVN turns out to be a Seer stan</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1627323775, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4038024692296505950", "title": "\u0421\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 Titanfall \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0441 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u00ab\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439\u00bb", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4038024692296505950", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Ran", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News158569/489ac1a882-3_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435, <strong>Respawn Entertainment</strong> \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0430 <strong>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </strong>\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0439 <strong>Apex Legends</strong>. \u0412 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 IP, \u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439.</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1627170780, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4038024692289589084", "title": "Respawn working on \"brand new single-player adventure\"", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/4038024692289589084", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2021/articles/2021-07-23-11-11/respawn-working-on-a-brand-new-single-player-adventure-1627035082018.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/90/format/jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Respawn sure seems to be busy right now - not only is it beavering away on Apex Legends (and <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/sources-ea-canceled-a-star-wars-battlefront-spinoff-l-1841840704\">reportedly a sequel</a> to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order), but we've also heard news about a new IP - and it seems this one is going to be a single-player game. </p><p>A number of <a href=\"https://www.respawn.com/careers/lead-technical-game-designer-singleplayer-incubation-team\">new job listings</a> have been posted on Respawn's website, with creative director Mohammad Alavi describing the project as a \"brand new Respawn single-player adventure\".

The new season will also introduce that much-anticipated Ranked mode for Arenas. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-19-apex-legends-next-character-is-microdrone-wielding-legend-seer\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1626717720, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4204657340180618505", "title": "Apex Legends' next character Seer is cursed with a deadly gaze", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4204657340180618505", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-seer-reveal-animation.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-legends-seer-reveal-animation.jpg\" /> <p>\n  Who doesn't love a bold fashion choice with a tragic backstory?

Well, some of it, anyway. \n\nOverflow differs from other Arena maps by being lane focused; where each location is separated by tall, lava-filled structures. With this separation, players cannot easily spot early decisions made by the other team and will need to stay vigilant before committing to a side or risk being flanked. While there are opportunities for long-range engagements, combat tends to favor short-to-medium ranges along either POI: Overlook or Slope.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/thrillseekers-event-blog/overflow-01.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nOverlook is a long, open area with a central interior that gives a height advantage over this POI. While this area is perfect for snipers or DMRs, players may want to hold the interior to control not only this area but their flank as well. Slope, as the name implies, offers both a high ground and a unique area where players can slide down to a remote part of the map.

There's always something to be updated, something to be iterated upon, and something new to be fashioned in order to keep millions of players around the world entertained, week after week. So how do developers find their fun amid this cycle of development for games that are constantly being updated?</p>\n<p>Well, in Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment's team of animators get their kicks from developing rare animations that'll only trigger for a small percentage of the player base at any one given time. These rare animations range from Octane twirling his syringe, to a weapon reloading in an unorthodox fashion. They might be a small part of the game - but it's where the animators of Apex Legends find their fun.</p>\n<p>Apex Legends animation lead Shawn Wilson, tells The Loadout that \"a lot of these animations come about when we have small pockets of free time.\" Wilson says that the rare animations hidden away in Apex Legends, like the magazine popping out of the top of the G7 Scout rifle, are one way that the development team relaxes and takes a load off at the end of a prolonged development period. It's a way for the development team to have some fun, knowing that they've got the \"core combat\" loop and metrics down and perfected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rarest-animations\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-seer-teaser\">Apex Legends teases potential new legend Seer in story trailer</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranked-mode-season-10\">Apex Legends Arenas will get a ranked mode in Season 10</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arenas-ranks\">Apex Legends Arenas ranks: ranking system explained and more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1625161813, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4032392655085861901", "title": "Apex Legends brings back the original Kings Canyon and World's Edge maps", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4032392655085861901", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-worlds-edge-old.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-worlds-edge-old.jpg\" /> <p>\n<a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' Genesis Collection Event started today, introducing lots of new cosmetics as Collection Events often do.

See the image above for the rundown.\n\n[h1]LEGEND BALANCE UPDATES[/h1]\n\n[b]Octane[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Launch Pad cooldown increased from 60 seconds to 90 seconds.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: Octane remains the most popular legend by a large margin even after the stim nerf. Turns out jump pads are fun, but with the added utility from the two launch options, it\u2019s only fair to bump up the cooldown.[/i]\n\n[b]Revenant[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Slightly slimmed down hitbox (specifically his midsection, arms, and upper legs).\n[/list]\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/genesis-collection-event/apex-legends-hitbox-revenant.png.adapt.1920w.png[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Stalker climb height significantly increased. It's not literally unlimited now, but... that boy can really climb.\n[*] Silence duration decreased from 20 seconds to 15 seconds.\n[*] Reduced the duration of death protection by 5 seconds while using the Death Totem.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: \nRevenant\u2019s large frame places him at a significant disadvantage in gunfights, particularly against smaller legends who no longer have Low Profile. We\u2019re shrinking some of his hitboxes to counteract this disadvantage, while also improving his ability to climb up walls and attack from unexpected angles. (We know this can be frustrating given how silent he is, so we'll continue to monitor and add sound if necessary.) That said, we\u2019re taking this opportunity to reduce some of the frustration that comes when playing against his tactical and ultimate.[/i]\n\n[b]Lifeline[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Increased hit box size, mostly in the legs and waist.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: \nUnlike Revenant, Lifeline excels in gunfights given her small hitbox. Even with the res shield gone, it\u2019s no surprise the smallest character in the game saw an uptick in performance with the removal of Low Profile. She remains small, but these hitbox changes bring her closer to the medium sized legends.[/i]\n\n[b]Bloodhound[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Eye of the Allfather scan revealed time decreased from 4 seconds to 3 seconds.\n[*] Beast of the Hunt duration decreased from 35 seconds to 30 seconds. Time can still be added by downing enemies.\n[*] \n[/list]\n[i]Dev Note: \nBloodhound has remained a popular and powerful pick for multiple seasons now, mostly because of the sheer amount of information that can be gained with one tap of their tactical.

BLAST Titans will be a European tournament with a \u20ac40,000 (around $45,000) prize pool, and 40 teams will take part in the first weekend's double elimination bracket.</p>\n<p>The first 20 teams are the \"top 20 European teams on recent form,\" which BLAST has calculated based off ALGS rankings, and includes 18 of the teams from the EMEA <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-2021-interview\">ALGS Championship</a> Final plus K1CK and Flight of Fancy.

Over the past 18 months, Apex Legends esports has gone from practically a non-entity - with only a couple of show matches and one-off tournaments - to hosting a worldwide tournament with a $2.5 million prize pool.</p>\n<p>With BLAST and Dreamhack also looking to get in on the Apex Legends esports action, things are looking positive for the battle royale's high-level scene. However, the journey hasn't been easy. The first major Apex Legends events, the EXP Invitational at X Games Minneapolis and the Preseason Invitational hosted in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, were held in August and September 2019 respectively. Since then, fans haven't been able to attend a single tournament in-person, and players have been forced to play online for reasons beyond their control.</p>\n<p>The effects of the global pandemic on the esports industry are clear, but the Apex Legends Global Series was set to launch just as lockdowns began and events shut down. As such, ALGS commissioner John Nelson had to scrap his roadmap of a year of in-person tournaments and adapt to an era of online competition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-2021-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/save-titanfall-hack\">Apex Legends targeted by hacker who wants to \"save Titanfall\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rarest-animations\">Rare Apex Legends animations help \"inject personality\" into its cast of characters</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 9</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1624377517, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4056035920069069794", "title": "\"No evidence\" of cheating at the ALGS Championship, says commissioner", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4056035920069069794", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apex-legends-wattson-algs-900x506.jpg\"/><p>The Apex Legends Global Series Championship came to its exciting conclusion on June 6, when <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-team-kungarna-wins\">Team Kungarna (formerly known as Bottom 20) surprised the world</a> to clinch the North American title.</p>\n<p>However last week, APAC South team Athaim, which placed third in its region's Championship Final, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-athaim-cheating\">voiced concerns about the competitive integrity</a> of the ALGS Championship. Athaim player 'Oatto' accused other teams of cheating, and believed that teams using faster hardware also had an advantage that would become apparent when LANs return. \"We feel this online event has made some players look better than they really are, due to cheating or fast PCs,\" he told The Loadout. \"At LANs [there is] an even playing field - no hiding cheats in your parent's house.\"</p>\n<p>Athaim's founder Oluwadamilola 'Ritehero' Akinleye confirmed to The Loadout that the accusations were specifically suggesting that opposing teams used aimbots in the tournament.

It's a system that the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-autumn-circuit-playoffs-results\">Apex Legends Global Series</a> uses to find the winners of its biggest esports tournaments, including the ALGS Championship, which wrapped up last week. While every team that lifted a trophy was fully deserving, some fans - and some players - believe that there is too much luck involved with the system.</p>\n<p>To win a Match Point game, teams must first achieve 50 points by placing highly in matches, or getting kills - and ideally both. Once a team has reached this threshold, it must then win one match outright to be crowned the tournament winner. This is where the controversy lies. Despite the fact that teams need to perform consistently in order to reach Match Point, there is an element of luck (based on the loot teams find or where the final circle pulls) that can impact the outcome of those crucial matches towards the end of a tournament..</p>\n<p>\"There's no denying the power of the Match Point format in terms of generating drama and enthusiasm around the competition,\" ALGS commissioner John Nelson tells The Loadout. Knowing who has won a tournament as soon as the final match finishes creates exciting endgames that are unique to Apex Legends esports, but not everybody is a fan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-match-point-john-nelson\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list: the best legends to use in Season 9</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 9: ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/save-apex-ranked-campaign\">Top Apex Legends players put pressure on Respawn to 'Save Apex Ranked'</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1624041273, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5019805792174474522", "title": "Team Kungarna wins the North American ALGS Championship", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/5019805792174474522", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apex-legends-global-series-championship-trophy-winner-900x506.jpg\"/><p>The ALGS Championship has finally reached its meteoric conclusion, with five regional tournaments spanning over 125 hours of tournament play squeezed into the past month.

The Apex Legends Global Series kicked off in January 2020, with grand plans of hosting its first Major at the Esports Stadium in Arlington, Texas in March and two Premier Events in Paris and Bucharest in April and May.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the live events never came to fruition, and the ALGS has never hosted a LAN tournament. Other than a handful of show matches and the legendary Preseason Invitational in Krak\u00f3w, Poland back in September 2019, Apex Legends as an esport has barely seen in-person events.</p>\n<p>Many players long for LANs, and the creators of the ALGS understandably want live events back too, when it's safe to do so. But the pandemic has also had a profound impact on the teams themselves, with many unable to compete in-person, and most playing in the biggest esports tournaments from the less than ideal comfort of their own bedrooms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/complexity-ishiny-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-athaim-cheating\">Apex Legends team voices cheating concerns following ALGS Championship</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-loba-third-impact\">How Loba is stealing the show at the ALGS Championship</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-winner-paradox\">\"Don't give up on your dreams,\" says South American ALGS Championship winner Paradox</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1622118572, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4069544815353442854", "title": "Apex Legends' Valkyrie will no longer be able to take mid-air \"coffee breaks\"", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/4069544815353442854", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2021/articles/2021-05-26-17-12/apex-legends-valkyrie-will-no-longer-be-able-to-take-mid-air-coffee-breaks-1622045526914.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/90/format/jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>There's normally a bit of tuning work to be done when a new legend is introduced to Apex Legends, and jetpack-wielding hero Valkyrie is no exception.

It reminds me a bit of when <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-12-fortnites-infinity-blade-is-wrecking-its-own-usd1m-tournament\">Fortnite players used planes</a> to stay out of battles until the very last moment. </p><p>In any case, the 10 percent fuel cost for hovering is now being removed entirely, and from Thursday onwards it will cost you the full 100 percent to hang around in the air. When asked why it was being removed rather than nerfed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RSPN_JayBiebs/status/1397340569685221377?s=20\">Larson said</a> that Respawn experimented with a 50-75 percent fuel cost, but found that this \"didn't feel meaningfully different and still allowed Valk to stay airborne for too long in certain final rings. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-26-apex-legends-valkyrie-will-no-longer-be-able-to-take-mid-air-coffee-breaks\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1622053260, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4069544815352565840", "title": "Apex Legends' Valkyrie will be nerfed to avoid ALGS Championship \"coffee breaks\"", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4069544815352565840", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apex-legends-valkyrie-chill-900x506.jpg\"/><p>An Apex Legends developer has revealed that Valkyrie's 'tactical hover' ability will be nerfed on Thursday, May 26, as Respawn developers are concerned with how it could be used in the ALGS Championship.</p>\n<p>The ability isn't listed as one of the new character's official abilities, but it concerns how her passive and tactical interact. When the newest entrant to the Apex Games uses her passive VTOL jets - that's her jet pack - it consumes fuel at a rapid rate to ensure she can't stay in the air for too long. However, that changes while Valkyrie is aiming her Missile Swarms.</p>\n<p>When aiming her tactical while in the air, Valkyrie consumes 10% of the usual fuel, allowing her to send an accurate cluster of paralysing missiles towards opposing teams. However, players have been abusing this 'tactical hover' interaction, especially during the final circles of competitive matches. As a result, Respawn is removing this feature as the developers are worried that it could impact the quality of the ALGS Championship.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/valkyrie-tactical-hover-nerf\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-athaim-cheating\">Apex Legends team voices cheating concerns following ALGS Championship</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-loba-third-impact\">How Loba is stealing the show at the ALGS Championship</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-winner-paradox\">\"Don't give up on your dreams,\" says South American ALGS Championship winner Paradox</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1622031982, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4069544181445879939", "title": "Apex Legends now punishes players who leave Arenas matches early", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4069544181445879939", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-season-9.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-legends-season-9.jpg\" /> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> added a new permanent 3v3 deathmatch mode, Arenas.

There will also be a 9,000-coin Animal Kingdom bundle, which includes all four bundles for a slight discount. EA will donate $20 from purchases of the big bundle to the Championship prize pool.</p>\n<p>While it seems a little random to introduce safari-themed skins to go alongside the Championship, this marks the next step in helping integrate regular players with the esports scene.

The Bocek seems to be getting a much more severe nerf, with maximum damage decreased from 70 to 60, stack size decreased from 16 to 14 and inventory slot count decreased from 48 to 28. The Bocek's charge up time and Deadeye's Tempo hop-up charge time are also being increased by 0.2 seconds. I imagine this is all to prevent this sort of thing from happening:</p><p>The update also brings a number of fixes to the game - including one for those <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-05-apex-legends-legacy-season-got-off-to-a-popular-but-rocky-start\">low-detail character models</a> (\"goodbye derpy blob Legends, you will be missed\" say the patch notes). At one point Valkyrie's passive was highlighting players that were \"not alive and/or in spectator mode,\" something that has also been fixed. Creepy. More importantly, the update brings some general stability improvements, which should hopefully help prevent some of the server issues we saw last week. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-12-apex-legends-update-nerfs-spitfire-and-bocek-bow\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1620820980, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4072920612520528518", "title": "Patch 9.0.1", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4072920612520528518", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Respawn Entertainment", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/139cf9bf02cb03cddece6c38153c85e6333d1563.png[/img]\n\n[h2]10:00 am PT Server + Client Patch:[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an error that was preventing players from logging in (\"Array index 1 is out of range\")\n[*] Arenas matches will now end if there are no players left on the enemy team\n[*] Arenas should now track \u201ctime survived\u201d more consistently\n[*] Arenas should no longer display the \"Apex Legends\" screen transition with incorrect textures sometimes\n[*] Fixed low detail player models in the lobby.

Just two days after launch, <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1172470\">Steam Charts</a> recorded Apex's highest ever peak of 330,000 players on the platform - an incredible 100,000 more than the previous record set back in March this year.</p>\n<p>However, the hype was quickly replaced by concerns over the performance of Apex's newest weapon - the Bocek bow. The Bocek is an absolute monster of a weapon. It's silent, hits hard - you can check the numbers in our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bocek-bow\">Bocek bow guide</a> - has no damage drop off, and even at mid-range is effectively hitscan. Oh, and it fits 48 arrows into a stack, making it incredibly inventory-efficient.</p>\n<p>Even pro players are having a nightmare of a time playing against the bow. Jack 'NiceWigg' Martin, for example, took to Twitter to vent his frustrations, saying the current meta is like \"fighting in a survival game\". Indeed, not knowing where and when you may be picked off by an arrow changes the dynamic of the game greatly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bocek-nerf-coming-soon\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.69</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-championship-weekend-1-review\">ALGS Championship opens with plenty of surprises and very little Valkyrie</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/nessy-signing-interview\">Finding an org: Nessy's rocky road to the ALGS Championship</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1620736376, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4072920612516761052", "title": "ALGS Championship groups revealed", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4072920612516761052", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apex-legends-wattson-shoot-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Apex Legends esports is going from strength to strength, as evidenced by the success of the Winter Circuit Playoffs.

This surpasses the previous most-watched ALGS tournament by over 50%.

After all, SoaR competes in the NA region, where Dazs lives and works, and in a LAN-less tournament scene it will rarely compete against teams from APAC North or any other region.

Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the Apex Games, former Apex Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat.\n\nThe rules are simple: 3-versus-3. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die.\n\nArenas features a new set of custom maps, tailor-made for close-quarters combat (with more to come in the future). Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy changes. The first team to win three rounds with at least a two-point lead will be crowned the victor\u2014unless they battle to a four-four tie. Then they\u2019ll have the honor of participating in Ash\u2019s favorite part of the game: Sudden Death.  \n\nFor more on Arenas, check out the blog for a full deep dive into the new mode. \n\n\n[h3]Party Crasher[/h3]\n[i]Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn\u2019t go as planned.

You\u2019ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you\u2019ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d55bf59e2f9274957762c2bb16385ece20d83b4b.png[/img]\n\nIn addition to the two new maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a bi-weekly rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you\u2019ll get [b]Artillery [/b]from Kings Canyon, [b]Thermal Station[/b] from World\u2019s Edge, and [b]Golden Gardens[/b] from Olympus. \n\n[h2]Valkyrie[/h2]\n\n[previewyoutube=PJYy-e3kXnU;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nKairi Imahara, the daughter of Apex Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father's Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart's help, she fashioned it into a sleek new jetpack that honors her family\u2019s legacy. Now, she\u2019s entered the Games under the name [b]VALKYRIE[/b]. \n\n[b]Passive: VTOL Jets[/b]\nUse your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and cannot use weapons while flying.\n\n[b]Tactical: Missile Swarm[/b]\nFire a swarm of mini-rockets which damage and disorient the enemy.\n\n[b]Ultimate: Skyward dive[/b]\nTake to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in.\n\n[b]Class: Recon[/b]\nScanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle\u2019s location.\n\n[h2]Bocek[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/25a237af66c2de325db04172e8797c04b7be3815.png[/img]\n\nThe new [b]Bocek [/b](pronounced bow-check) compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. \n\nThe Bocek uses a new ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The 1x hcog classic, 1x holosight, 2x hcog, 1x-2x variable, and 3x hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can also be further modified with the two new hop-ups entering the game, Shatter Caps and Deadeye\u2019s Tempo; it can even equip both hop-ups simultaneously!\n\n[h2]Olympus - The Lost Fleet Update[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/acfae18491f78f1c10a6a76afcef71e46eb940cb.png[/img]\n\nA fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing.\n\nRead our latest [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/olympus-map-update]map update blog[/url] to get a detailed look at what\u2019s changed on Olympus.\n\nTo allow everyone to see the latest map update, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the new season. \n\n[h2]Starter Kit and Loot Changes[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d5cd455de63650fd85154849d8269963685bad39.png[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Players will now start a match with a \u201cStarter Kit\u201d consisting of a Level 1 EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus two Shield Cells and Syringes each.\n[*] We\u2019ve removed Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool.\n[*] Spawn chances for Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced.\n[*] Along with the lowered or removed spawn chances for these items, we\u2019ve rebalanced the loot pool such that higher-level versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often (weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc.)\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev note[/b]\nWe've wanted to take a crack at improving the loot game for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the game, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we're always adding new items to the pool. The recent Locked & Loaded takeover mode helped us field-test some of the changes we're looking to make moving forward: certain pieces of loot, and low-tier loot types specifically, are being put on notice.\n\nWe're removing Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed like the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they don't really feel like a character improvement in the way that things like, say, a Backpack feels (getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!).\n\nWe're keeping Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool (albeit at a lower spawn chance) in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for \"shield-swapping\" shenanigans.\n\nFinally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the game is also intended to improve the \"hot drop\" situation: having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before.\n\nBe on the lookout for more loot changes in the future! This will be an ongoing project.[/i]\n\n[h2]Emotes[/h2]\n\nIntroducing [b]Emotes[/b]! Every Legend will have one emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through Apex packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It\u2019s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner\u2019s podium. \n\nNow, since emotes kick your camera back to a third-person view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn\u2019t see in first-person view will not be shown while you are in third person.\n\nThis video shows the \u201cAnti-Peek\u201d feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the 3rd person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn\u2019t have. All emotes have Anti-Peek enabled and there is no way to disable it.\n\n[h2]Battlepass[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c0d00952e6602718b5545a53279b83e1aae8a078.jpg[/img]\n\nUnlock the premium Legacy Battle Pass and level it up to unlock new skins like Rampart\u2019s Crafty Kitsune at Premium Level 25 and Wraith\u2019s Demon\u2019s Whisper at Premium Level 50. \n\n[h1]Legend Updates[/h1]\nLow Profile Characters\nLow profile no longer exists! This trait has been removed from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. \n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nAfter our successful experiment with Wraith's hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger Legends through changes to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to go the way of the dodo. (Sorry dodos.)\n[/i]\n\n[h2]Lifeline[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Combat Revive[/b]: No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive two players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield.\n[*] [b]D.O.C. Heal Drone[/b]: Heal rate increased from 5hp per second to 8hp per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly 33%.\n[*] [b]Care Package[/b]: Cooldown reduced from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade (if possible) in three categories: Body Shield, Other Equipment (Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield), and Weapon Attachment, based on your team\u2019s current gear when the Package arrives.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nLifeline\u2019s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely strong to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed like they were becoming more and more obsolete. These changes are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making D.O.C. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive.[/i]\n\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Stim[/b]: Reduced cooldown between stims from 4s to 1s. Increased health cost from 12hp to 20hp\n[*] Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low[b] Launch Pad[/b] trajectory.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nOctane continues to perform really well after the latest changes. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we\u2019d like to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default.\n[/i]\n\n\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Burglar's Best Friend[/b]: Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating.\n[*] Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail.\n[*] [b]Black Market Boutique[/b]: Increased cooldown from 90s to 120s.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Gravity Lift[/b]: Reduced lift speed by 30%. Reduced side-to-side acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to 2 seconds. Increased cooldown from 15s to 20s.\n[*] Horizon\u2019s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nHorizon is powerful and popular, but that's not why we're making these changes. We believe that mistakes in Apex Legends should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just wasn't true. These changes have two goals: 1) make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and 2) make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower.[/i]\n\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Knuckle Cluster[/b]: Fuse now has two stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from 25s to 20s.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nMore help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he doesn't just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities.[/i]\n\n[h2]Bangalore[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Smoke Launcher[/b]: Thickened Bangalore\u2019s smoke. \n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nLast patch we optimized Bangalore\u2019s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations.\n[/i]\n\n[h2]Bloodhound[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] No longer receives assists from [b]Eye of the Allfather[/b].\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nBloodhound's scan is strong, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There's enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it's a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other non-damaging abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto's drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to.[/i]\n\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Crypto's drone can now scan and open care packages.\n[*] Can no longer use his drone to \"hijack\" a respawn beacon that's already in use.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Weapons Updates[/h1]\n\n[h2]Marksman Weapon Category[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/2fe89a31156d112fa4ad6631b001985b3a3138c0.png[/img]\n\nThe G7 Scout and the 30-30 are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category. \n\nWith the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a new weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the G7, 30-30, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to medium-long range, and are the sort of in-betweens of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers.\n\nFor starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons; They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts.\n\n[h2]Supply Drop Rotation[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/83c0c2aa85e69e7792e02d34cf86648301939f1b.png[/img]\n\nThis season, we\u2019re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon changes down below.\n\n[b]Crate Weapon Drop Rates:[/b]\nSince we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early game and more often in the mid game to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early game crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late game crate weapon.\n\n[h2]Fully Kitted Rotation[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/eb021e369b59c6aac5c99774f5b77e15b35d33c4.png[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Added: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel\n[*] Removed: R301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Hop Ups[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Shatter Caps - Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek.  \n[*] Deadeye\u2019s Tempo - Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. \n[*] To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won\u2019t be available.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Assault Rifles[/h2]\nReducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from 2.0 to 1.75\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nThis was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the R301, Flatline, and Havoc.[/i]\n\n[h2]Peacekeeper[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off\n[*] Pellet damage reduced from 10 to 9\n[*] Rechamber time increased from 0.9 seconds to 1.1 seconds\n[*] Reload times increased (regular from 2.45 to 2.5, empty from 3.35 to 3.5)\n[*] Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels (from 0.65/0.45/0.2 to 0.85/0.65/0.35)\n[*] Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nSince the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are also reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now.[/i]\n\n[h2]Triple Take[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] As a crate weapon, it will come with a 9 ammo clip and 63 reserve ammo\n[*] Fire rate increased from 1.2 to 1.3\n[*] Time to full charge reduced from 1.1 seconds to 1 second\n[*] Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS\n[*] Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs\n[*] Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Havoc[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nThis should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in mid-range fights.[/i]\n\n[h2]Spitfire[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nThe Spitfire is too strong at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we\u2019re prepared to make more changes to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful. [/i]\n\n[h2]30-30 Repeater[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased leg damage multiplier from 0.75 to 0.85\n[*] Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nThe 30-30 could use some love, so we\u2019re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does.  This should make it a bit more consistent without raising it\u2019s high \u201cbest case\u201d damage potential.[/i]\n\n[h2]G7 Scout[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs\n[*] Increased hipfire spread size (reduced accuracy) to be more in line with other marksman weapons\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nThe 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the G7 Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons.[/i]\n\n[h2]Longbow[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15\n[/list]\n\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nAs we\u2019ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we\u2019re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff.[/i]\n\n[h2]Mozambique[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased magazine capacity from 4 to 6\n[*] Moved the lower 2 pellets inward in the blast pattern\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nThis brings up the baseline power level so \u201conly\u201d finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints\n[/i]\n\n[h2]P2020[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased bullet damage from 15 to 18\n[*] Lowered fire rate from 8.5 to 6.25\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nSimilar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the P2020\u2019s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn\u2019t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the P2020.  [/i]\n\n[h2]Arc Stars[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Aim and movement slow removed from the initial stick.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nSticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it's a rare occurrence that's difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the follow-up explosion makes it hard to counter against a coordinated team. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick.\n[/i]\n\n[h1]Quality of Life[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by \u201call\u201d or \u201cunlocked only\u201d. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It\u2019s so much better!\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/076b717b8fd4fe4214bb842c36ba479f66b2e84f.png[/img]\n\n[*] When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the team.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/65ce0eb1761958545bcb6e9f5ab65329768d6340.png[/img]\n\n[*] Challenges can now be \u201cfavorited\u201d by going into the challenges menu and right clicking a challenge. That Challenge will then be added to a new favorites tab that will appear in the lobby and in the match\u2019s map screen. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/9316a5087f7e59bef4862b95b9c46c2219aef7bf.png[/img]\n\n[*] Pressing and Holding F2 while in-game will bring up the ability description page for your character. This is only available on PC.\n[*] Players can now request better equipment by going into their inventory and pinging a piece of equipment.\n[*] Your first Challenge Reroll of the day is now free.\n[*] Rerolling your challenges will allow you to choose from either BR-focused challenges or Arenas-focused ones.\n[*] Holo Sprays, Quips, and Emotes, can be favorited. These will be used whenever the player is prompted to do a random emote.\n[*] Club Invites v2 - You can now include what you want to play when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list.\n[*] Ranked: Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors. \n[*] Flight path adjustments: Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a before/after comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/4709e1ea0102ca95117415f673da9b0c6443c334.png[/img]\n\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Ring Update[/h2]\nWe're continuing work from the Fight Night update to improve match pacing towards the end of the game. We're slowing down the closing speed of the late game Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We're also reducing the \"waiting\" time before Rings 4 and 6 start to close.\n\n[list]\n[*] Ring 4 pre-shrink time reduced from 2:00 to 1:45\n[*] Ring 4 shrink speed reduced from 33 second close time to 40 seconds\n[*] Ring 5 shrink speed reduced from 20 second close time to 40 seconds\n[*] Ring 6 pre-shrink time reduced from 1:30 to 1:00\n[*] Ring 6 shrink speed reduced from 1:40 close time to 2:00\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]\n\nBloodhound\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with the Tactical UI not showing while in Bloodhound\u2019s Ultimate.\n[/list]\n\nPathfinder\n[list]\n[*] Gas Traps and Jump Pads will no longer float into the sky when placed next to a zipline. \n[/list]\n\nWraith\n[list]\n[*] Slight wall bumps no longer inadvertently cancel Wraith\u2019s tactical. \n[/list]\n\nMirage\n[list]\n[*] Decoys no longer die after a tick of thermite damage. \n[/list]\n\nOctane\n[list]\n[*] Ordinances will no longer get stuck and disappear when being bounced off of Jump Pads.\n[*] Death Totems will no longer bounce when a Jump Pad is placed under it.\n[*] Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the Fight Night ring via a Jump Pad. \n[*] Updated Octane\u2019s Helicopter emote to correctly remove his leg for which he is using it to do said helicoptering.\n[/list]\n\nWattson\n[list]\n[*] Fixed the \u201cExtend\u201d prompt for Watson\u2019s fences not appearing in certain situations. \n[*] Haute Drop skin will no longer block view when reloading the Sentinel.\n[/list]\n\nLoba\n[list]\n[*] Fixed more areas where Loba\u2019s Bracelet fails. \n[*] Red Handed skin on consoles will now properly animate.\n[*] \n[/list]\n\nRampart\n[list]\n[*] Mobile Respawn Beacon now has proper collision with Amped Cover.\n[*] Jumping on and off a damaged Shiela will no longer transfer the flame effect to your weapon.\n[/list]\n\nHorizon\n[list]\n[*] Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the fight night ring via a Gravity Lift.\n[*] 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins.\n[*] Fixed an issue with NEWT not getting refunded if it immediately dies due to a bad spot. \n[/list]\n\nFuse\n[list]\n[*] 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins.\n[/list]\n\nFlatline\n[list]\n[*] Part of the iron sight was being displayed over the whole weapon.\n[/list]\n\nProwler\n[list]\n[*] Supply Drop Prowler can now toggle fire modes.\n[/list]\n\nSentinel\n[list]\n[*] Moved tool tips to not overlap hop up icons.\n[*] Fixed a graphical issue when swapping to Sentinel.\n[/list]\n\nMisc.\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a menu issue with the advanced look options being hidden.\n[*] Survey beacons will now appear on the map when teammates are respawned. \n[/list]\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1620076437, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045878088284455", "title": "Apex Legends \u2013 Legacy Gameplay and Introducing Arenas", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4074045878088284455", "is_external_url": true, "author": "ea admin", "contents": "[previewyoutube=ChZaqqoNg-0;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nApex Legends \u2013 Legacy brings a new form of competition: Arenas.

As one of the original legends in the game, and thanks to his protective and brotherly nature, Apex players have taken to the gentle giant. Plus, it helps that he's pretty useful in-game as well - ranking highly on our Apex Legends tier list and featuring in the majority of ALGS teams.</p>\n<p>However, as Apex Legends Season 9 introduces ground emotes which further display characters' personalities - Bloodhound has some raven troubles, and Loba plays golf with Revenant's head, for instance - Gibraltar's emote has come under fire. M\u0101ori gamer Taikawa 'Teebagginz_' Tamati-Elliffe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Teebagginz_/status/1387886637925896193\">tweeted</a> saying that \"[Respawn] better have some form of cultural consultation cos that's shit if you're ripping off my proud heritage, identity and culture.\"</p>\n<p>Many problems arise from the fact that Gibraltar's heritage is non-specific. Fan wikis say that he is from the Pacific Islands, which his gear seems to draw inspiration from, but that he is not specifically Polynesian, M\u0101ori, or Samoan. However, this is not referenced, and Gibraltar's official description on the EA website only mentions his fictional home world of Solace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/gibraltar-haka\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-championship-animal-kingdom-skins\">Apex Legends' new skins will help grow the ALGS Championship prize pool</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranked-kill-points\">Top Apex Legends pros want kill points removed from ranked</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/avangard-gll-ban\">Apex Legends team Avangard stripped of GLL title two weeks after victory</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1619806264, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045878076759132", "title": "Titanfall 2 Free Weekend", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4074045878076759132", "is_external_url": true, "author": "ea admin", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c16a30a985c794b1ba9de527e4622eca97c077c3.png[/img]\n\nWe heard people want to play Titanfall 2 this weekend?

Set to run alongside Apex's standard battle royale matches, Arenas has been described as the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-26-apex-legends-unveils-3v3-arenas-mode-the-first-step-in-going-beyond-battle-royale\">\"first step\" in moving Apex Legends beyond battle royale</a>. And as it turns out, the first pitch document for Arenas was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pinedsman/status/1386734505801617412?s=20\">inspired by Auto Chess</a>: a pretty surprising choice given that battle royales and auto chess, erm, aren't particularly alike. </p><p>It all made me wonder what sort of wacky experiments Respawn is carrying out behind the scenes, and what we could potentially see next. Could it be single-player modes, co-op, gauntlet runs? So I decided to put this question to Respawn in an interview with chief operating manager and Apex Legends general manager Dusty Welch, and game director Chad Grenier. It seems that the Apex Legends team is keen to venture further into areas such as PvE - and pointed to previous Apex experiments as an example. </p><p>\"We dipped our toes in a PvE mode a few seasons back with quests,\" Grenier said. \"And the team certainly loves to make that kind of content. A lot of our team comes from a single-player background... we made the single-player campaign in Titanfall 2. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-29-respawn-would-love-to-deliver-more-single-player-pve-content-for-apex-legends\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1619776800, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045878074973178", "title": "\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043a \"\u0410\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\": \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 Apex Legends", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4074045878074973178", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0421\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News156634/feb3399f82-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u0423\u0436\u0435 4 \u043c\u0430\u044f \u0432 <strong>Apex Legends </strong>\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d, \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \"<strong>\u0410\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430</strong>\". \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432.</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1619740141, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045878073844229", "title": "Apex Legends breaks down new hero and \"winged avenger\" Valkyrie in abilities trailer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/4074045878073844229", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2021/articles/2021-04-29-21-14/apex-legends-breaks-down-new-hero-and-winged-avenger-valkyrie-in-abilities-trailer-1619727277958.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/90/format/jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Apex Legends' ninth season, Legacy, is a bit of a big 'un; alongside map changes to Olympus and a new 3v3 arenas mode, it introduces a brand-new hero in the form of \"winged avenger\" Valkyrie, who's now been detailed more thoroughly ahead of Legacy's launch on 4th May.</p><p>As revealed in developer Respawn's <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-19-apex-legends-reveals-new-legend-valkyrie\">recent Stories from the Outlands video</a>, Kairi \"Valkyrie\" Imahara is the daughter of Titanfall 2 antagonist Viper.

Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the Apex Games, former Apex Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat.\n\nThe rules are simple: 3-versus-3. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die.\n\nArenas features a new set of custom maps, tailor-made for close-quarters combat (with more to come in the future). Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy changes. The first team to win three rounds with at least a two-point lead will be crowned the victor\u2014unless they battle to a four-four tie. Then they\u2019ll have the honor of participating in Ash\u2019s favorite part of the game: Sudden Death.  \n\nFor more on Arenas, check out the blog for a full deep dive into the new mode. \n\n\n[h3]Party Crasher[/h3]\n[i]Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn\u2019t go as planned.

This arena takes place in a ritzy, downtown plaza where players can choose to engage on the crashed Mirage Voyage, or the opulent two story buildings that make up the downtown. Stay vigilante, as this map hosts a variety of engagement distances\u2014both close quarters and long distance.\n\n[h3]Phase Runner[/h3]\n[i]The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn\u2019t the first of its kind.[/i]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/75fe2134ad58fa8a9e104a885374d4ee7e319b56.png[/img]\n\n[b]Phase Runner[/b] is the second of our custom arenas, and our largest. You\u2019ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you\u2019ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d55bf59e2f9274957762c2bb16385ece20d83b4b.png[/img]\n\nIn addition to the two new maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a bi-weekly rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you\u2019ll get [b]Artillery [/b]from Kings Canyon, [b]Thermal Station[/b] from World\u2019s Edge, and [b]Golden Gardens[/b] from Olympus. \n\n[h2]Valkyrie[/h2]\n\n[previewyoutube=PJYy-e3kXnU;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nKairi Imahara, the daughter of Apex Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father's Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart's help, she fashioned it into a sleek new jetpack that honors her family\u2019s legacy. Now, she\u2019s entered the Games under the name [b]VALKYRIE[/b]. \n\n[b]Passive: VTOL Jets[/b]\nUse your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and cannot use weapons while flying.\n\n[b]Tactical: Missile Swarm[/b]\nFire a swarm of mini-rockets which damage and disorient the enemy.\n\n[b]Ultimate: Skyward dive[/b]\nTake to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in.\n\n[b]Class: Recon[/b]\nScanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle\u2019s location.\n\n[h2]Bocek[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/25a237af66c2de325db04172e8797c04b7be3815.png[/img]\n\nThe new [b]Bocek [/b](pronounced bow-check) compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. \n\nThe Bocek uses a new ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The 1x hcog classic, 1x holosight, 2x hcog, 1x-2x variable, and 3x hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can also be further modified with the two new hop-ups entering the game, Shatter Caps and Deadeye\u2019s Tempo; it can even equip both hop-ups simultaneously!\n\n[h2]Olympus - The Lost Fleet Update[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/acfae18491f78f1c10a6a76afcef71e46eb940cb.png[/img]\n\nA fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing.\n\nRead our latest [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/olympus-map-update]map update blog[/url] to get a detailed look at what\u2019s changed on Olympus.\n\nTo allow everyone to see the latest map update, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the new season. \n\n[h2]Starter Kit and Loot Changes[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/d5cd455de63650fd85154849d8269963685bad39.png[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Players will now start a match with a \u201cStarter Kit\u201d consisting of a Level 1 EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus two Shield Cells and Syringes each.\n[*] We\u2019ve removed Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool.\n[*] Spawn chances for Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced.\n[*] Along with the lowered or removed spawn chances for these items, we\u2019ve rebalanced the loot pool such that higher-level versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often (weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc.)\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev note[/b]\nWe've wanted to take a crack at improving the loot game for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the game, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we're always adding new items to the pool. The recent Locked & Loaded takeover mode helped us field-test some of the changes we're looking to make moving forward: certain pieces of loot, and low-tier loot types specifically, are being put on notice.\n\nWe're removing Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed like the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they don't really feel like a character improvement in the way that things like, say, a Backpack feels (getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!).\n\nWe're keeping Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool (albeit at a lower spawn chance) in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for \"shield-swapping\" shenanigans.\n\nFinally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the game is also intended to improve the \"hot drop\" situation: having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before.\n\nBe on the lookout for more loot changes in the future! This will be an ongoing project.[/i]\n\n[h2]Emotes[/h2]\n\nIntroducing [b]Emotes[/b]! Every Legend will have one emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through Apex packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It\u2019s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner\u2019s podium. \n\nNow, since emotes kick your camera back to a third-person view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn\u2019t see in first-person view will not be shown while you are in third person.\n\nThis video shows the \u201cAnti-Peek\u201d feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the 3rd person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn\u2019t have. All emotes have Anti-Peek enabled and there is no way to disable it.\n\n[h2]Battlepass[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/c0d00952e6602718b5545a53279b83e1aae8a078.jpg[/img]\n\nUnlock the premium Legacy Battle Pass and level it up to unlock new skins like Rampart\u2019s Crafty Kitsune at Premium Level 25 and Wraith\u2019s Demon\u2019s Whisper at Premium Level 50. \n\n[h1]Legend Updates[/h1]\nLow Profile Characters\nLow profile no longer exists! This trait has been removed from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. \n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nAfter our successful experiment with Wraith's hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger Legends through changes to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to go the way of the dodo. (Sorry dodos.)\n[/i]\n\n[h2]Lifeline[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Combat Revive[/b]: No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive two players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield.\n[*] [b]D.O.C. Heal Drone[/b]: Heal rate increased from 5hp per second to 8hp per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly 33%.\n[*] [b]Care Package[/b]: Cooldown reduced from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade (if possible) in three categories: Body Shield, Other Equipment (Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield), and Weapon Attachment, based on your team\u2019s current gear when the Package arrives.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nLifeline\u2019s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely strong to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed like they were becoming more and more obsolete. These changes are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making D.O.C. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive.[/i]\n\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Stim[/b]: Reduced cooldown between stims from 4s to 1s. Increased health cost from 12hp to 20hp\n[*] Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low[b] Launch Pad[/b] trajectory.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nOctane continues to perform really well after the latest changes. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we\u2019d like to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default.\n[/i]\n\n\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Burglar's Best Friend[/b]: Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating.\n[*] Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail.\n[*] [b]Black Market Boutique[/b]: Increased cooldown from 90s to 120s.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Gravity Lift[/b]: Reduced lift speed by 30%. Reduced side-to-side acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to 2 seconds. Increased cooldown from 15s to 20s.\n[*] Horizon\u2019s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nHorizon is powerful and popular, but that's not why we're making these changes. We believe that mistakes in Apex Legends should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just wasn't true. These changes have two goals: 1) make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and 2) make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower.[/i]\n\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Knuckle Cluster[/b]: Fuse now has two stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from 25s to 20s.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nMore help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he doesn't just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities.[/i]\n\n[h2]Bangalore[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Smoke Launcher[/b]: Thickened Bangalore\u2019s smoke. \n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nLast patch we optimized Bangalore\u2019s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations.\n[/i]\n\n[h2]Bloodhound[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] No longer receives assists from [b]Eye of the Allfather[/b].\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nBloodhound's scan is strong, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There's enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it's a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other non-damaging abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto's drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to.[/i]\n\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Crypto's drone can now scan and open care packages.\n[*] Can no longer use his drone to \"hijack\" a respawn beacon that's already in use.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Weapons Updates[/h1]\n\n[h2]Marksman Weapon Category[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/2fe89a31156d112fa4ad6631b001985b3a3138c0.png[/img]\n\nThe G7 Scout and the 30-30 are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category. \n\nWith the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a new weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the G7, 30-30, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to medium-long range, and are the sort of in-betweens of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers.\n\nFor starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons; They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts.\n\n[h2]Supply Drop Rotation[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/83c0c2aa85e69e7792e02d34cf86648301939f1b.png[/img]\n\nThis season, we\u2019re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon changes down below.\n\n[b]Crate Weapon Drop Rates:[/b]\nSince we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early game and more often in the mid game to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early game crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late game crate weapon.\n\n[h2]Fully Kitted Rotation[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/eb021e369b59c6aac5c99774f5b77e15b35d33c4.png[/img]\n\n[list]\n[*] Added: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel\n[*] Removed: R301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Hop Ups[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Shatter Caps - Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek.  \n[*] Deadeye\u2019s Tempo - Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. \n[*] To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won\u2019t be available.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Assault Rifles[/h2]\nReducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from 2.0 to 1.75\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nThis was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the R301, Flatline, and Havoc.[/i]\n\n[h2]Peacekeeper[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off\n[*] Pellet damage reduced from 10 to 9\n[*] Rechamber time increased from 0.9 seconds to 1.1 seconds\n[*] Reload times increased (regular from 2.45 to 2.5, empty from 3.35 to 3.5)\n[*] Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels (from 0.65/0.45/0.2 to 0.85/0.65/0.35)\n[*] Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nSince the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are also reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now.[/i]\n\n[h2]Triple Take[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] As a crate weapon, it will come with a 9 ammo clip and 63 reserve ammo\n[*] Fire rate increased from 1.2 to 1.3\n[*] Time to full charge reduced from 1.1 seconds to 1 second\n[*] Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS\n[*] Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs\n[*] Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Havoc[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nThis should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in mid-range fights.[/i]\n\n[h2]Spitfire[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nThe Spitfire is too strong at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we\u2019re prepared to make more changes to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful. [/i]\n\n[h2]30-30 Repeater[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased leg damage multiplier from 0.75 to 0.85\n[*] Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nThe 30-30 could use some love, so we\u2019re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does.  This should make it a bit more consistent without raising it\u2019s high \u201cbest case\u201d damage potential.[/i]\n\n[h2]G7 Scout[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs\n[*] Increased hipfire spread size (reduced accuracy) to be more in line with other marksman weapons\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nThe 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the G7 Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons.[/i]\n\n[h2]Longbow[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15\n[/list]\n\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nAs we\u2019ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we\u2019re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff.[/i]\n\n[h2]Mozambique[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased magazine capacity from 4 to 6\n[*] Moved the lower 2 pellets inward in the blast pattern\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note [/b]\nThis brings up the baseline power level so \u201conly\u201d finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints\n[/i]\n\n[h2]P2020[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased bullet damage from 15 to 18\n[*] Lowered fire rate from 8.5 to 6.25\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nSimilar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the P2020\u2019s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn\u2019t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the P2020.  [/i]\n\n[h2]Arc Stars[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Aim and movement slow removed from the initial stick.\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Dev Note[/b]\nSticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it's a rare occurrence that's difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the follow-up explosion makes it hard to counter against a coordinated team. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick.\n[/i]\n\n[h1]Quality of Life[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by \u201call\u201d or \u201cunlocked only\u201d. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It\u2019s so much better!\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/076b717b8fd4fe4214bb842c36ba479f66b2e84f.png[/img]\n\n[*] When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the team.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/65ce0eb1761958545bcb6e9f5ab65329768d6340.png[/img]\n\n[*] Challenges can now be \u201cfavorited\u201d by going into the challenges menu and right clicking a challenge. That Challenge will then be added to a new favorites tab that will appear in the lobby and in the match\u2019s map screen. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/9316a5087f7e59bef4862b95b9c46c2219aef7bf.png[/img]\n\n[*] Pressing and Holding F2 while in-game will bring up the ability description page for your character. This is only available on PC.\n[*] Players can now request better equipment by going into their inventory and pinging a piece of equipment.\n[*] Your first Challenge Reroll of the day is now free.\n[*] Rerolling your challenges will allow you to choose from either BR-focused challenges or Arenas-focused ones.\n[*] Holo Sprays, Quips, and Emotes, can be favorited. These will be used whenever the player is prompted to do a random emote.\n[*] Club Invites v2 - You can now include what you want to play when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list.\n[*] Ranked: Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors. \n[*] Flight path adjustments: Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a before/after comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/4709e1ea0102ca95117415f673da9b0c6443c334.png[/img]\n\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Ring Update[/h2]\nWe're continuing work from the Fight Night update to improve match pacing towards the end of the game. We're slowing down the closing speed of the late game Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We're also reducing the \"waiting\" time before Rings 4 and 6 start to close.\n\n[list]\n[*] Ring 4 pre-shrink time reduced from 2:00 to 1:45\n[*] Ring 4 shrink speed reduced from 33 second close time to 40 seconds\n[*] Ring 5 shrink speed reduced from 20 second close time to 40 seconds\n[*] Ring 6 pre-shrink time reduced from 1:30 to 1:00\n[*] Ring 6 shrink speed reduced from 1:40 close time to 2:00\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Bug Fixes[/h1]\n\nBloodhound\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with the Tactical UI not showing while in Bloodhound\u2019s Ultimate.\n[/list]\n\nPathfinder\n[list]\n[*] Gas Traps and Jump Pads will no longer float into the sky when placed next to a zipline. \n[/list]\n\nWraith\n[list]\n[*] Slight wall bumps no longer inadvertently cancel Wraith\u2019s tactical. \n[/list]\n\nMirage\n[list]\n[*] Decoys no longer die after a tick of thermite damage. \n[/list]\n\nOctane\n[list]\n[*] Ordinances will no longer get stuck and disappear when being bounced off of Jump Pads.\n[*] Death Totems will no longer bounce when a Jump Pad is placed under it.\n[*] Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the Fight Night ring via a Jump Pad. \n[*] Updated Octane\u2019s Helicopter emote to correctly remove his leg for which he is using it to do said helicoptering.\n[/list]\n\nWattson\n[list]\n[*] Fixed the \u201cExtend\u201d prompt for Watson\u2019s fences not appearing in certain situations. \n[*] Haute Drop skin will no longer block view when reloading the Sentinel.\n[/list]\n\nLoba\n[list]\n[*] Fixed more areas where Loba\u2019s Bracelet fails. \n[*] Red Handed skin on consoles will now properly animate.\n[*] \n[/list]\n\nRampart\n[list]\n[*] Mobile Respawn Beacon now has proper collision with Amped Cover.\n[*] Jumping on and off a damaged Shiela will no longer transfer the flame effect to your weapon.\n[/list]\n\nHorizon\n[list]\n[*] Players will no longer have weapons drawn if they are knocked as they enter the fight night ring via a Gravity Lift.\n[*] 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins.\n[*] Fixed an issue with NEWT not getting refunded if it immediately dies due to a bad spot. \n[/list]\n\nFuse\n[list]\n[*] 1x holo sight will no longer block view when using certain skins.\n[/list]\n\nFlatline\n[list]\n[*] Part of the iron sight was being displayed over the whole weapon.\n[/list]\n\nProwler\n[list]\n[*] Supply Drop Prowler can now toggle fire modes.\n[/list]\n\nSentinel\n[list]\n[*] Moved tool tips to not overlap hop up icons.\n[*] Fixed a graphical issue when swapping to Sentinel.\n[/list]\n\nMisc.\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a menu issue with the advanced look options being hidden.\n[*] Survey beacons will now appear on the map when teammates are respawned. \n[/list]\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1619716327, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045878073112653", "title": "My best Apex Legends Arenas fight ended in desperate punching", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4074045878073112653", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-valkyrie-jetpack.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-legends-valkyrie-jetpack.jpg\" /> <p>\nNext week, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' ninth season arrives, and with it comes new jetpacking character Valkyrie and the 3v3 Arenas game mode.

To address all these concerns, Respawn has now published a developer deep dive aiming to \"demystify\" some of the problems, and explain what the team is doing to address them. You might want to put the kettle on, as this one's a long read. </p><p>Written by lead engineer Samy \"Ricklesauceur\" Duc, the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/servers-netcode-developer-deep-dive\">blog post</a> notes that Respawn has made some changes to how it tracks server issues. The introduction of a performance display in Season 6 meant players could report their problems more accurately, and Respawn also began tracking key performance metrics for players and servers. In recent seasons, Respawn also used a data science team to systematically analyse performance data. But despite all this, Duc said this approach means Respawn can still be slow to fix problems. </p><p>\"From the moment you start noticing problems, it may take us up to two weeks to find a fix, and even more to deploy the solution if it requires a server patch,\" Duc said. \"We can do better. We will do better. So let's talk about solutions.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-29-respawn-discusses-apex-legends-server-issues-in-mammoth-blog-post\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1619702160, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045878069598748", "title": "Golden Week Sale", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4074045878069598748", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Electronic Arts", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/1912d4f2a54fb2617f0ad82a86e4d84b7966629d.png[/img]\n\nGolden Week Sale is now live in Apex Legends until the end of Season 8.

One poor soul was betrayed by their squadmates and used by another team to farm kills: effectively trapping them in an endless death loop. </p><p>Reddit user \"MohSSEEZZ\" posted a clip of a diamond ranked game in which their random squadmates stood by and allowed them to be brutally murdered by another team. At this point MohSSEZZ's teammates collected their banner, respawned them, and allowed them to be murdered by the other team once again.  </p><p>MohSSEZZ said they were killed and respawned three times before eventually deciding to leave the ranked game. The reason why this is particularly bad is that Apex Legends penalises you for leaving a ranked game early, so MohSSEZZ had to choose between an infinite death loop or taking an abandonment penalty. It seems they eventually decided on the latter, and MohSSEEZZ said they \"got a ban for leaving the game [because] I didn't wanna give them more points\". </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-28-ranked-apex-legends-player-gets-stuck-in-death-loop-after-teammates-betray-them-to-farm-kills\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1619632440, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045244022829901", "title": "SolaFide owner banned from Riot events over non-payment of LoL team", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4074045244022829901", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sola-fide-logo-900x506.jpg\"/><p><strong>28/04/2021</strong> SolaFide's Apex Legends roster has also separated from the organisation.</p>\n<p>SolaFide owner Colin 'Oddity' Ethan has been <a href=\"https://lolesports.com/article/competitive-ruling-solafide-esports/blt057288d4bbbadf03\">banned from Riot-sanctioned leagues and events</a> indefinitely after failing to pay the organisation's League of Legends players, coaches, and management staff since January 1, 2021. This means that SolaFide cannot compete in Riot tournaments unless the team changes ownership. Even if it does so, it can only apply for reinstatement for a league position in 2024 at the earliest.</p>\n<p>According to Riot, Oddity assured team members that the initial delay to their January pay was due to a \"banking issue,\" but players and staff grew increasingly concerned as they also did not receive their payment for February's work. At this point, Oddity sent the team members a message to say they would be paid within 72 hours, but again this did not happen. Furthermore, he did not make requested \"good faith\" payments to two team members who desperately needed money.</p>\n<p>As well as unpaid wages, SolaFide team members did not receive their prize winnings from the Risen Champions League tournament. Four out of SolaFide's five players were registered on league-recognised contracts on the Global Contract Database, which have been contravened by the team's non-payment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/league-of-legends/sola-fide-oddity-ban\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/banned-no-reason-issue\">Apex Legends bug that banned players for no reason reportedly fixed</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bocek-bow\">Apex Legends Bocek bow: stats, hop-ups, and attachments</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.68</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1619547532, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045244021492457", "title": "\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0438: \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0435 Apex Legends", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4074045244021492457", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0421\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News156573/09541e4c47-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u044f<strong> Respawn </strong>\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \"<strong>\u041d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0435</strong>\" (<strong>Legacy</strong>). \u0420\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043e \u0434\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u00a0\u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 <u><strong>\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 4 \u043c\u0430\u044f</strong></u>.\u00a0</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1619476140, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4074045244019033193", "title": "Apex Legends Arenas ranks: ranking system explained and more", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4074045244019033193", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/apex-legends-arenas-ranks-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/arena-mode-release-date\">Apex Legends' Arenas</a> mode is great fun - who doesn't want 3v3 battles in cool new locations?

Eventually, Shiv figured out a workaround by using an indecipherable screen name, but the problem was clear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/hacks-exploit-patch-april\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/rhythm-game\">Apex Legends' new bow turns the battle royale into a rhythm game</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/league-of-legends/sola-fide-oddity-ban\">SolaFide owner banned from Riot events over non-payment of LoL team</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/shivfps-twitch-ban\">Apex Legends streamer ShivFPS banned after tirade against hacker</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1618921467, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4570566565009532170", "title": "Apex Legends new character is the daughter of a Titanfall 2 boss", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Rock, Paper, Shotgun/4570566565009532170", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-valkyrie.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/apex-valkyrie.jpg\" /> <p>\nRespawn Entertainment have revealed that the next character jumping into the <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> arena is Valkyrie.

Titanfall fans will be thrilled to see the newest addition to <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/valk-abilities\">Apex Legends, Valkyrie</a>, enter the fray as she is iconic villain Viper's daughter. Meanwhile, the introduction of a new 3v3 Arena game mode - our guide for which you can check out here - allows players to enjoy the popular FPS game at an even greater tempo, thanks to its quick fire rounds.</p>\n<p>However, one new addition to Apex Legends Season 9 which has particularly excited us is its latest weapon, the Bocek <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MonsterclipRSPN/status/1384189069475782671?s=20\">(pronounced 'bow-check')</a> compound bow - and it hits hard. According to its <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/legacy\">official flavour text</a>, the Bocek is \"a powerful and deadly weapon, for those with the skill to wield it. Capable of inflicting tremendous damage at medium range, you'll need to make each shot count.\"</p>\n<p>'Bocek' may seem like a simple poetic name for a bow, but it actually stems from a long-running Respawn naming convention whereby components of the Apex (and Titanfall) universes are named after developers. For example, the Kraber sniper rifle is named after Senior Audio Director Erik Kraber. This time, it's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmusedApricot/status/1385276162826379265?s=20\">weapon designer David Bocek</a> who has the honour of being immortalised in-game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bocek-bow\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes: what's new in patch 1.69</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/valkyrie-tactical-hover-nerf\">Apex Legends' Valkyrie will be nerfed to avoid ALGS Championship \"coffee breaks\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-championship-weekend-1-review\">ALGS Championship opens with plenty of surprises and very little Valkyrie</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1618856256, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4570566565007080564", "title": "Apex Legends Mobile will be a \"new game,\" and won't have crossplay", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4570566565007080564", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apex-legends-mobile-bloodhound-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Apex Legends is finally coming to mobile devices.

Furthermore, it will feature entirely different battle passes and cosmetics specifically for mobile players.</p>\n<p>According to Apex Legends' game director Chad Grenier, the regular Apex Legends development team is working with a partner studio and \"a dedicated team... filled with experts in mobile game development.\" Initially the game will be tested in India and the Philippines, where \"a few thousand\" players will be able to jump into matches on Android devices.

The event has gone down in Apex Legends folklore, simply due to the fact that it's one of the only live, in-person events that the battle royale game has ever seen. The Finals went on for an astonishing 11 rounds before TSM was crowned the victor, and despite the match point system needing tweaks - as <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-commissioner-interview\">ALGS commissioner John Nelson told us last week</a> - the Preseason Invitational was considered a success.</p>\n<p>\"That was a great opportunity to tell the story [of the tournament], because we had everybody there,\" explains EA's head of broadcast, Joe Lynch. \"We could show all the players, we could show that emotion. When 789 was making their big runs out of nowhere, we could actually interview them, talk to them, and see the expression when they got finished. Or when TSM won the whole thing, we could see that excitement in them and we could tell that emotional story. That was a good start.\"</p>\n<p>Lynch's most challenging task when broadcasting a battle royale tournament is simple: \"How do you tell the story?\" When he works on the broadcasts for other EA titles, things are much more simple. In FIFA and Madden, matches are 1v1 - the stories tell themselves. But with 20 teams and 60 players competing in <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/tournaments/apex-legends-global-series\">Apex Legends Global Series</a> tournaments, analysing and telling the stories of even a single match becomes a daunting task.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-broadcast-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/league-of-legends/sola-fide-oddity-ban\">SolaFide owner banned from Riot events over non-payment of LoL team</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/shivfps-twitch-ban\">Apex Legends streamer ShivFPS banned after tirade against hacker</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 8: ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1618851507, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4570566564995415225", "title": "Apex Legends player gets team disqualified by going for a poo", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4570566564995415225", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apex-legends-octane-900x506.jpg\"/><p>A Thai Apex Legends pro has got his team disqualified from a GLL APAC South tournament after his girlfriend played for him while he apparently used the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Lertpong 'Dexter' Nakurai, Sinchai 'Chambers' Sotsiao, and Teerachock 'Killoposz' Muedin are a well-known trio in Apex esports.

Yes it is and you'll be pleased to know that it's super easy to set up. Finding a game these days that you can actually play online with friends on different platforms is tough, but Apex Legends is one of the best for cross-platform play. While it might have taken an absolute age for Apex Legends crossplay to be set up, the community is all the better for it now.</p>\n<p>With crossplay set as default, everyone, whether they're playing on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, or even the Nintendo Switch, can now come together for a couple of games on Kings Canyon, World's Edge, and Olympus, and, let's be honest, that's pretty special.</p>\n<p>So if you're sat there twiddling your thumbs, trying to work out how the hell crossplay works, then don't worry, we've got you covered.

Play five rotating  limited-time takeovers over two weeks. Shields regenerate in Shield Regen, round time is reduced whenever a Legend dies in Killing Time, automatically retrieve fallen banners in Auto Banners, compete for top loot in Ultra Zones, and get a free respawn in Second Chance.\n\n[h1]WAR GAMES TAKEOVERS[/h1]\n[h3]SECOND CHANCE[/h3]\nWe\u2019re kicking things off with a bang on April 13th with our first modifier: Second Chance. In this modifier, each Legend is granted one free respawn per match. Once a Legend is killed, their Respawn Token is consumed as they rise again from their current location retaining all their weapons and gear. After a short duration, the player respawns high in the air to skydive back into the action.\nNote that, while Second Chance is active, Players will be unable to Unlock Assassin, Wake, or Wrath badges, since these prestigious badges would be far easier to unlock in this mode. \n\n[h3]ULTRA ZONES[/h3]\nThen we shake up your ideal drop strategy with Ultra Zones! Ultra Zones introduce the concept of multiple Hot Zones within a single map. More epic loot, more gold items! But wait, there\u2019s more! Each Hot Zone is enveloped in a Flash Point\u2014a returning feature from a Season 6 LTM. For those who don\u2019t already know, Flash Points are enormous, glowing bubbles that replenish your HP and shields when you stand in them. In this mode, consumable items are still available as normal throughout the loot pool.\n\n[h3]AUTO BANNERS[/h3]\nTune-in mid event for Auto Banners. In this modifier we\u2019ve made a rather small but spicy change to squadmate respawning. Your Squadmates Banner Cards are automatically retrieved! No need to loot their death box to retrieve their Banner Cards, just head straight to a respawn beacon. The loot pool has been altered to contain more Mobile Respawn Beacons too.\n\n[h3]KILLING TIME[/h3]\nFeel the pressure with Killing Time. This event speeds up the match as Legends fall. During a round, whenever a Legend dies, the round time is reduced. If any given round is a massacre, you can bet that ring will be closing real quick! Keep an eye on the round timer and the ring in this modifier.\n\n[h3]ARMOR REGEN[/h3]\nWe\u2019re closing out the event with Armor Regen. That\u2019s right: your armor regenerates over time at a rate of 12 points per second. Whenever you take damage, your armor will begin regenerating after an 8-second delay. This delay is doubled to 16 seconds if your armor gets cracked. One last thing for this mode: there are no Shield Cells in the loot pool!\n\n[h2]Modifier Schedule[/h2]\nAll modes begin and end during mornings, PT time.\n[list]\n[*] Second Chance: Tuesday, 4/13 \u2013 Thursday, 4/15\n[*] Ultra Zones: Thursday, 4/15 \u2013 Monday, 4/19\n[*] Auto Banners: Monday, 4/19 \u2013 Wednesday, 4/21\n[*] Killing Time: Wednesday, 4/21 \u2013 Friday, 4/23\n[*] Armor Regen: Friday, 4/23 \u2013 Tuesday, 4/27\n[/list]\nAs you can see, each takeover mode only lasts for a few days at most.

Like a real-life drone EMP. </p><p>Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/md7frq/i_have_undeniable_proof_the_4_and_6_predators_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">two videos</a> appeared on Reddit showing a game in which a top-ranked Apex Legends player was knocked down, only for the server to then mysteriously crash. How convenient. When the legitimate players reconnected to the server, they found themselves knocked down - and could see the suspicious duo standing over them. The offending fourth and sixth-ranked players were then accused of carrying out a DDoS attack once they started losing in order to get an easy win. (A \"distributed denial of service\" attack basically overwhelms a server with requests, thus preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.) Given their high placement in Ranked mode, it seems likely the pair had DDoS-ed their way to the top of the leaderboard. </p><p>In any case, it seems Respawn agreed with this assessment, as security analyst Conor \"Hideouts\" Ford <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/md7j2j/undeniable_proof_that_the_4_and_6_xbox_preds_are/gs8wm6w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">confirmed the pair have been banned</a>.  </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-26-top-ranked-apex-legends-players-banned-for-using-ddos-attacks-to-win-games\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1616761860, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4026754911345686593", "title": "Apex Legends Global Series Championship dates confirmed", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4026754911345686593", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apex-legends-chaos-theory-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Respawn and EA have announced the official dates for the ALGS Championship, Apex Legends' flagship tournament.

However, one player took it upon himself to make things more difficult by not using any guns on his road to success.</p>\n<p>No guns, you say? How could one do such a thing? While we're disappointed that Matthieu 'Mp\u00e9' Pereira hasn't checked out our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list</a>, his feat is nonetheless mightily impressive. Using only grenades and his trusty fists, Mp\u00e9 punched and pummelled his way to Diamond rank, which requires an astonishing 7,200 RP and puts him in the top 4.37% of players.</p>\n<p>You might think that Mp\u00e9 resorted to ratting it out to the final few teams, or that he relied on teammates to carry him to victories, but that is not the case. His aggressive playstyle utilises legends such as Bloodhound or Fuse running headfirst into fights, fists flying.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/mpe-no-guns-diamond-rank\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/competitive-game-modes-algs\">Apex Legends Global Series commissioner is \"looking to support\" future game modes with tournaments</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-winter-circuit-playoffs-2021\">Apex Legends Global Series Winter Circuit Playoffs winners</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-championship-2021-dates-revealed\">Apex Legends Global Series Championship dates confirmed</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1616151094, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4048146376707051776", "title": "Apex Legends: Overtime comic series set to release this summer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4048146376707051776", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/apex-legends-pathfinder-happy-waving-the-loadout-1080-1920-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Apex Legends fans may have only just got the hang of playing on the move with the <a href=\"https://www.pockettactics.com/apex-legends/switch-review\">Nintendo Switch port</a>, but now the hit battle royale game is entering another medium entirely. Apex Legends: Overtime is a comic series produced by Dark Horse comics, who create the comics that supplement the Overwatch and God of War lore.</p>\n<p>Dark Horse also published Pathfinder's Quest - a hefty tome which filled out a lot of gaps in the Apex Legends lore - last month. Apex Legends has a history of publishing digital comics in-game to tell the stories of each season, but this will be the first time the beautiful scenes will see print. If you're sick of climbing the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranks</a>, perhaps it's time to cool things down with some reading?</p>\n<p>The four-issue limited release has been written by Titanfall writer Jesse Stern, with Respawn writers Tom Casiello and Manny Hagopian also on board. Having writers of this calibre, with a history intertwined with the Titanfall universe, is a sure sign of the comics' quality, and fans are already excited at the prospect of more lore content for the popular FPS game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/overtime-comic-release-date\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-winter-circuit-playoffs-2021\">Apex Legends Global Series Winter Circuit Playoffs winners</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/algs-championship-2021-dates-revealed\">Apex Legends Global Series Championship dates confirmed</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/octane-revenant-algs-meta\">High risk, high reward: Why Apex Legends pros are taking a chance on Octane</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1615998272, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5556851879148803504", "title": "That horrible noise in your Apex Legends matches should be going away today", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/5556851879148803504", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apex-legends-heat-shield-bug-fix-900x506.jpg\"/><p>If you've played a single match of <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a>' Chaos Theory event, you'll undoubtedly have experienced the near-deafening sounds that plague Mad Maggie's Kings Canyon takeover.

According to Boggs, Apex Legends will run at 720p when docked and 576p in handheld, with a frame-rate of 30FPS in both modes. </p><p>Given that the Switch port will come with cross-play, some players have expressed concerns that Switch players will be at a disadvantage against other platforms (particularly given the game is capped at 60FPS on console and 144FPS on PC, with ways to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/jozyft/apex_on_steam_capped_at_144_fps/\">get around the latter</a>). As detailed in the Famitsu interview there will be an option to disable cross-play, so you can choose whether to pool with other Switch users or give yourself a real challenge against PC and console. Hopefully the Switch-only pool will have plenty of players for matchmaking.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-09-respawn-details-apex-legends-frame-rate-and-resolution-on-switch\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1615289820, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4057152305716997307", "title": "Winter Circuit #4", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4057152305716997307", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Respawn Entertainment", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/dc1ead6f9c751727cf4f3e6dd1b5caa1a8636a64.jpg[/img]\n\nTune in on March 7th as the ALGS Winter Circuit continues with the Online Tournament #4.

Thanks to the power of science, this update is bringing a big batch of changes, from new ways to play to the long-awaited launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe Chaos Theory Collection Event kicks off March 9th, 2021 and runs until March 23rd, 2021.\n\nToday we\u2019ll be telling you about:\n\n[list]\n[*] The launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch \n[*] The Caustic Town Takeover\n[*] The Ring Fury Escalation Takeover \n[*] The new \u201cHeat Shield\u201d item and accompanying Survival Slot in your inventory\n[*] A \u201cNo Fill\u201d queue option for brave (or is it cocky?) solo Legends\n[*] The Chaos Theory Collection Event and its associated rewards track, collectible cosmetics, and the new Bangalore heirloom\n[/list]\n\nAnd a chaotic blast of balance changes, quality-of-life updates, and bug fixes\nRead on for details.\n\n[previewyoutube=VZgBbKihSwI;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n\n[h2]NINTENDO SWITCH LAUNCH[/h2]\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nOn Tuesday, March 9th, Apex Legends is launching on Switch with support for cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.\n\nSince we\u2019re launching a few weeks after the start of Season 8, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their Season 8 Battle Pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.\n\nPlus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we\u2019re also launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin (called P.A.T.H.) as a free reward for players who boot up Apex Legends on Switch between the game\u2019s launch and the end of Season 8 - Mayhem (May 4th, 2021).\n\n[h2]CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER[/h2]\n\nWhen life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nWhere Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? \n\nForever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires \u201ctest subjects\u201d to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nIf you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one\u2019s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it.\n\n[h2]RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\n\nRing Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. \n\nThose who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round\u2019s Ring. You\u2019ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there\u2019s one opening up nearby.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nSo how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we\u2019re introducing called Heat Shields. \n\n[h2]HEAT SHIELDS[/h2]\n\nDuring the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nHeat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you\u2019re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus.\n\nBut watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it\u2019s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don\u2019t expect it to last very long in the final rounds.\n\nAfter the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot.\n\n[h2]SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots\u2014instead, it resides in the brand new \u201cSurvival Slot\u201d. \n\nThe Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there\u2019s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars!\n\nLike the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. \n\n[h2]INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS[/h2]\n\nLike previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected.\n\nHowever, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an \u201cEscalation Takeover,\u201d which means that every few days during the event, we\u2019re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting!\n\nGood luck out there.\n\n[h2]NO-FILL MATCHMAKING[/h2]\n\nTL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here\u2019s how it works, and why you might choose to use it.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nIn the lobby, you\u2019ll now see a checkbox entitled \u201cFill Matchmaking\u201d. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play.\n\nUnchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with \u201cFill Matchmaking\u201d unchecked, you\u2019ll go in alone. You\u2019ll be on a team of one, against teams of three.\n\nWe still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we\u2019re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.\n\nHere\u2019s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for:\n\n[list]\n[*] Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges\n[*] Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights\n[*] Challenge yourself\u2014can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios?\n[*] Experience the latest lore teaser on your own\n[*] Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven\u2019t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace.\n[/list]\n\nWe have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don\u2019t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn\u2019t available in Ranked.\n\nGive it a shot and let us know what you think.\n\n[h2]CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK[/h2]\n\nIt ain\u2019t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let\u2019s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nYou can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once.\n\nAnd of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. \n\nInspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena.\n\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you\u2019ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. \n\nBangalore took this Pilot\u2019s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she\u2019s made it her own.\n\nAfter the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. \n\nA few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: \n\nFirst, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended.\n\nSecond, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates:\n\n[img] https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg [/img]\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions]FAQ[/url].\n\n[h2]LEGEND UPDATES[/h2]\n\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes.\n[*] Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp \u2192 12hp.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Dev note:[/h3] Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It\u2019s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic\u2019s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly.\n\n[h2]Pathfinder[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Removed Low Profile\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Dev Note:[/h2] Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it\u2019s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size.\n\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Revenant[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Revenant\u2019s Silence now disables Mirage\u2019s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane\u2019s Swift Mend.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Wattson[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane\u2019s current health regen rate).\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage.\n[*] Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila.\n\n[h2]WEAPON UPDATE[/h2]\n\n[h2]Weapon Optics[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Pellet damage decreased from 13 \u2192 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 \u2192 1.1.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The goal of these changes are to place this weapon\u2019s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end.\n\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]  +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Hemlok[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Increased hip-fire spread.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok\u2019s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end.\n\n[h2]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h2]\n\nKings Canyon Loot - we\u2019ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. \n\n[list]\n[*] The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. \n[*] Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High.\n[*] Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship.\n[*] Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality.\n[/list]\n\nLocked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight.  This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle.\n\nAssists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don\u2019t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator \u201ceye\u201d icon.\n\nAssists and Knocks have been added to your squad\u2019s banners and will show at the end of a match.\nClub names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. \n\nItems will no longer \u201cstick\u201d to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator.\n\nBadge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you\u2019re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you\u2019ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nPing My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. \n\nGold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy\u2014based on the tier of armor they wear\u2014while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress.\n\nPlayers on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game.\n\nAdded numbers to the Advanced Look Controls. This should help people experiment and easily revert back to their favorite settings.\n\nWhen scanning a beacon for Ring 6, you should now be able to see the location where Ring 6 finishes.\n\nInspect Weapon - Since the Survival Slot took its button on controller (we only have so many buttons!), Inspect Weapon has been moved to the emote wheel by default. It can be bound to any key on PC.\n\n[h2]BUG FIXES[/h2]\n\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Corrected an issue with Gibraltar not getting hit registrations when simultaneously releasing ADS and shooting while his Gun Shield was up\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Wraith[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Wraith players can no longer cancel Into the Void by jumping at a wall\n[*] The New Skydive Emote will now work with Legendary Skins\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a bug that was causing Nox Gas to flicker for some players affected by it\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Repeatedly using the same jump pad no longer disables double-jumps\n[*] Players are no longer allowed to \u201cglide\u201d along a wall after using the jump pad\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Crypto\u2019s animation to bring out his Drone is no longer skippable by throwing a holospray\n[*] Crypto can no longer teleport to a replicator\n[*] Reloading the Mastiff and 30-30 will no longer be faster while in Crypto\u2019s drone\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a few areas Loba could teleport into that would get her stuck\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Players can no longer use Sheila to get under the world when placed too close to the Phase Runner in Olympus\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed the Gravity Lift falling through the floor when used on the train tracks in World\u2019s Edge\u2019s Sorting Factory\n[*] Using a zipline after a Gravity Lift will no longer increase accuracy\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Motherload will now damage and destroy jump pads\n[*] When under a small enclosure, players will no longer be pushed out after using Motherload\n[*] Players can no longer double their grenades after looting a dead Fuse\u2019s deathbox\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Dropping and picking up the Mastiff will no longer cause it to be reloaded\n[/list]\n\n[h2]3030 Repeater[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Dropping and picking up the 30-30 will no longer cause it to be reloaded\n[*] 30-30 will now have spread deviation when ADS firing and jumping\n[*] \n[/list]\n\n[h2]MISC[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing Steam users from sending friend requests to each other\n[*] Usernames now update when a user swaps between the Origin Client to the Steam Client\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing players from creating or joining clubs due to their EA Account already being associated with another platform\n[/list]\n\nThat\u2019s all for now.

Respawn's hit FPS game celebrated its second anniversary in style, ending February with 50,000 more concurrent players on Steam than it had at the beginning of the month. It also broke its peak player record over the weekend, with Steam Charts registering <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1172470\">a high of 196,799 players</a> on February 27.

The game itself has continued to evolve since its launch, with Respawn eager to keep the experience fresh. Over the last couple of years we have seen maps come, go, and even return with major changes.

The interdimensional skirmisher has been a top-tier legend since the game released two years ago, but a recent hitbox nerf seems to be putting players off.</p>\n<p>Wraith's abilities allow her to teleport short distances and create portals for teammates to jump through, which are undoubtedly a powerful tool in the right hands. However, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Respawn increased the size of her hitbox in Season 8</a>, which seems to have impacted her usability. While she retained the Low Profile ability that makes her harder to hit, this seems to be a change too far for many players.</p>\n<p>While she still looks very strong (and retains her spot at the top of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>), being easier to hit can make a big difference in a firefight. Even a slight increase to her hitbox could prove devastating to her usefulness - as Pathfinder mains found out when his was nerfed last year. However, as Wraith's abilities so far remain unchanged, which was not the case for Pathy, we don't expect her fall from grace to be quite as dramatic as the loveable robot's.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wraith-nerf-season-8\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/solos-no-fill\">Apex Legends is finally getting solos - sort of</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1614009136, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4059402835315462061", "title": "Last Chance!", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4059402835315462061", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Respawn Entertainment", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/de2abf30346d21f0a41dc42f4094553f04ac6596.jpg[/img]\n\nThe celebration is almost over and if you haven\u2019t already, make sure to finish the reward track for your free Apex Packs and finish the Collection Event to get your Heirloom Shards!", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1613790355, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4059402835309742632", "title": "Exclusive \u201cOff Ramp\u201d Weapon Charm", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4059402835309742632", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Electronic Arts", "contents": "[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/1f7aac5ec69ef58a32d43673be772e5030be6b4c.png[/img]\n\nGet more ways to show off your style as you bring the boom in Apex Legends\u2122 this season.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/subscriptions/ea", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1613654536, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4703417046218673467", "title": "COVER YOUR BRUDDAHS WITH THE GIBRALTAR EDITION", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4703417046218673467", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Respawn Entertainment", "contents": "[previewyoutube=1Lx-N_FpEx4;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nCatch some waves\u2014and some grub\u2014with the Gibraltar Edition.

They\u2019ll simply grant you 700 Apex Coins (their purchase cost).\n\nThat\u2019s all for now. But before we go, we want to say, again, thank you. The last two years has been incredible, and it\u2019s all thanks to the community that has formed around this game. Here\u2019s to two years, and to the future\u2014the best is yet to come!\n\nSee you in the Arena.\n\n\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1612898271, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4051520458187924879", "title": "Life after North: How MCD won its first Apex Legends tournament without an organisation", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4051520458187924879", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apex-legends-fuse-abilities-900x506.jpg\"/><p>\"Obviously no team wants to be orgless,\" says Dan 'rpr' U&scaron;i\u0107. \"It's not a good feeling.\" rpr makes up the Dan portion of Mikkel, Can, & Dan (also known as MCD), the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> team that was released from North's roster on December 31, 2020.

I\u2019d like to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story.\n\n\n[b]ORIGIN STORY & LAUNCH[/b]\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-origin-story.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\n\nAfter shipping Titanfall 2 we were hard at work on post-release Titanfall content and naturally starting to explore ideas for another game. Apex Legends wasn\u2019t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying new ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing new game modes, and two designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our game.\n\nAlmost two years before the release of Apex Legends, we had our first company-wide playtest on a new game mode called \u2018Survival\u2019 where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, battle royale style.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-survival-mode.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n[i]Early \u2018survival\u2019 game mode put 24 pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of 3 by running to and entering the same droppod together[/i]\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-real-big-map.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\nOur prototype map called \u2018real big map\u2019 was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely\n\nFast forward another month, and the team working on this new game mode had grown to over 20 people. In October of 2017 we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in game, in November of 2017 we did our first 50 player game successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\\n[i]The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones[/i]\n\nThe gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being removed to slow down the pace of the game and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the game for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a new phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn\u2019t stop playing!\n\nThere was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this new mode we were building.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-chalk-board.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n[i]A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of \u2018Friday Night Fights\u2019 playtest winners[/i]\n\n\nThe name of the game turned from \u201cSurvival\u201d to \u201cApex Predator\u201d. Kings Canyon became more like Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping new mechanics like respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would force the entire team to playtest without headsets, and with player names turned off, so we could build a best in class in-game communication system.\n\n\nIt became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then all-hands on what would eventually be called \u201cApex Legends\u201d and would never look back.\n\nOf course, thinking you have a great game on your hands doesn\u2019t mean the world will love what you\u2019ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our game did at launch. \n\nKnowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall game, we opted to go with a secret launch so players could immediately play the game when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the game if they could just play it.\n\nA few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the game to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to play the game for two hours. Two hours turned into eight, and they didn\u2019t want to put it down. The team was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement!\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-viewing.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-playtest.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nOn Feb 4th, 2019 we would launch our game to the world's surprise. We hoped some players would download the game and love it, but also knew that creating a free-to-play game was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed game launch.\n\nI remember one of our live ops engineers (responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale) setting expectations and telling the team \u201cDon\u2019t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months!\u201d\n\nAs the entire team stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the game launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in games!\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-1-million.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nEight hours later while we\u2019re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to go give that live ops engineer some crap!\n\nThree days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to 10 million players, and then 24 days after launch hit 50 million players.\n\n[b]TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE[/b]\n\nSince launch we\u2019ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major in-game events. We\u2019ve added two new maps, vehicles, eight new legends, and countless other limited-time game modes and improvements to the game.\n\nThe game continues to grow. Next month, we\u2019ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of Apex Legends is well underway. And later this year, we\u2019ll launch new ways to play the game that take us beyond battle royale.\n\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\n\nWe\u2019ve learned how to run a successful live service game, how important player sentiment is, and how it\u2019s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer game.\n\nFor us, Apex Legends is more than a game. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for 30 minutes a day. It\u2019s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It\u2019s also a game that takes a stance on the importance of diversity.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our game has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer gaming more accessible. We\u2019ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how Apex helped save their lives.\n\nIt\u2019s you, the players, that motivate us to create games, it always has been. \n\nThank you for playing, Legends. Your support and love over the last two years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving force as we continue to make Apex all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, and all the rest to come.\n\n\u2013 Chad\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1612478793, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4051520269926425061", "title": "Apex Legends Anniversary Collection Event Trailer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4051520269926425061", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Electronic Arts", "contents": "[previewyoutube=rjIMSRMtVfw;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nCan you believe it\u2019s been two years?

To mark the occasion, Respawn has released a number of images showing the game in its early stages, which reveal a little more about how the game evolved from its Titanfall roots. </p><p>After the launch of Titanfall 2, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-30-apex-legends-newest-map-was-a-titanfall-3-concept\">Respawn initially began work on Titanfall 3</a>, but this was parked after the developer began to experiment with a battle royale mode in the Titanfall universe - and this became Apex Legends. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/two-years-of-apex-legends\">new blog post</a> by game director Chad Grenier, the prototype was initially made by two designers, and was then developed into a game mode called \"Survival\" which allowed pilots and titans to battle it out to be last man standing. It seems the mode had a slightly smaller lobby size than current-day Apex, with a total of 24 pilots instead of 60, but the idea of teams of three dropping together was present even in these very early stages. Squads would arrive in style inside a drop pod, however, which teams would have to enter as a trio inside the drop ship.</p><p>Soon, Apex's team size grew to over 20 people, and by October 2017 Respawn had the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith. The prototype map was apparently rather different from Kings Canyon, and was rather imaginatively called \"real big map\". It was sparse enough for \"titans to roam freely\", but both titans and wall running later had to be removed for the sake of game balance. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-03-apex-legends-first-map-was-sparse-enough-for-titans-to-roam-freely\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1612371360, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4051520269922054461", "title": "Apex Legends Anniversary Collection Event prices anger fans", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4051520269922054461", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apex-legends-pathfinder-900x506.jpg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> fans are already annoyed at the Anniversary Collection Event - and it isn't even expected to kick off until February 9.

His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it\u2019s time to really bring the boom, Fuse uses \u201cWally\u201d to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames.\n\n[b]Passive - Grenadier[/b]\n\nStack an extra grenade per inventory slot.

This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with.\n\n\n[b]KINGS CANYON MAP UPDATE[/b]\nSeason 8 once again sees changes to Kings Canyon. The main new point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some new observation towers for basic recon or a sniper\u2019s nest. Read more on the map changes in the map blog [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-8-map-updates]here.\n\n[/url]\n\n\n[b]LEGENDARY MAGAZINES[/b]\nSeason 8 introduces the Gold-tier magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons.\n\n\n[b]QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES[/b]\nDamage counter\n\n[list]\n[*] We have now added a damage counter to the HUD.

For the skins that represent an important part of that character's backstory, we've added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend's life.\n[/list]\n\n[b]LEGEND META[/b]\nWraith: Hitbox adjustments.\nDev Note:\nWe know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day one. With Season 7 hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith.\n\nWraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends, but the changes stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we\u2019re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas.\n\n\nEven with these changes, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future.\n\n[b]Rampart:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Sheila angle increase from 120\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n[*] Wall health in build phase increased from 1hp to 45hp (sniper rounds still pierce through)\n[/list]\n\nDev Note:\nRampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a game as fast-moving as Apex, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We\u2019re keeping a careful eye on this one.\n\n[b]Horizon:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from 21s to 25s. The 15s cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears.\n[/list]\nDev Note:\nHorizon released strong, to the point where she rivals Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown changes have a significant effect.\n\n[b]Octane:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Launch Pad Remastered: Many players may have known about Octane\u2019s \u201csuper-jump\u201d that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad. Once the double-jump option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old super-jump.\n[/list]\n\n[list]\n[*] Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc (the speed and trajectory of the old super-jump).\n[*] From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they\u2019ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Crypto:[/b]\n\nRemove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones.\n\n\n[b]Loba:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Caustic:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic\u2019s team is eliminated.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Mirage:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Mirage decoys create footstep sounds.\n[/list]\n\nDev Note:\nThis change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night patch notes when it was in fact coming with this patch. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won\u2019t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone.\n\n[b]WEAPON META[/b]\n\n\n[b]Fully Kitted Rotation[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Removed: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator\n[*] Added: R-301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, Spitfire\n[/list]\n\n[b]Attachments[/b]\n[list]\n[*] We are removing the Gold Barrel from the loot pool \n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Hop Ups[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The Double Tap hop up will be removed from the loot pool\n[*] The Anvil Rounds hop up will be added into the loot pool\n[/list]\n\n[b]Volt[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Bullet damage decreased from 16 to 15\n[/list]\n\n[b]Alternator[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 15 to 16\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Spitfire[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 18 to 19\n[*] Reload speed increased from 2.8 seconds to 3.2\n[*] Empty Reload speed increased from 3.33 seconds to 3.8\n[/list]\n\n[b]EVA 8[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fire rate increased from 2.0 to 2.1\n[/list]\n\n[b]BUG FIXES[/b]\n\n[b]Caustic[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Sonar abilities no longer stop Caustic\u2019s highlight vision.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Loba[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a few exploitable areas on Kings Canyon that Loba was able to reach via her Bracelet.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Rampart[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Jumpads in Octane\u2019s town takeover no longer allow Rampart to place Sheila on them.\n[*] Fixed an issue with Rampart's passive persisting even after changing characters in Firing Range\n[/list]\n\n[b]\nHavoc[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue causing the Havoc to have 100% accuracy when hip-fired through Rampart\u2019s Amped Cover.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Peacekeeper[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a POV issue that occurred when using Horizon\u2019s abilities, then immediately going into ADS with a Peacekeeper.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Clubs[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Re-enabled ability to invite friends to club from friends list\n[*] Fixed an issue causing some users who have opted out of \"Last Squad Invites\" to not appear in club event timelines when placing in the top 5 of a match\n[*] Failing to connect to the club database no longer leads to a misleading \"Kicked from club\" message\n[*] Players will no longer be kicked from clubs when switching to another profile on Xbox.\n[/list]\n\n[b]MISC[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with crowds not cheering in Pathfinder\u2019s Town takeover.\n[*] Fixed an issue preventing some heirlooms from appearing in the heirloom shop.\n[*] Fixed an issue that allowed Thermites to deal damage through certain walls on Olympus.\n[/list]\n\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1612205754, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470, "tags": ["patchnotes"]}, {"gid": "4050393736353555998", "title": "Apex Legends Season 8 \u2013 Mayhem Battle Pass Trailer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4050393736353555998", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Electronic Arts", "contents": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aprRC9PNMNU", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1612204496, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4050393736353486170", "title": "Apex Legends Season 8 dishes out nerfs to Wraith and Horizon", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4050393736353486170", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wraith-apex-legends-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Respawn has revealed the patch notes for its Season 8 - Mayhem update, and eight legends are getting balance tweaks ahead of Fuse's debut in the battle royale.</p>\n<p>While the changes to Kings Canyon and the addition of Fuse and the 30-30 Repeater rifle are well documented by now, the balance changes to half the roster and a lot of weapon tweaks mean the meta is getting a good old shakeup for the new season. On the legends front, two of Season 7's most powerful legends, Wraith and Horizon, are getting nerfs, while the virtually useless Rampart gets generous buffs in an attempt to up her play rate and win rate.</p>\n<p>For Wraith, her hitbox has been increased to make her slightly easier to hit than in previous seasons. Respawn says it didn't want to miss with her kit, so thought a Pathfinder-style hitbox tweak would make her slightly less overpowered. Heck, she's at the top of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a> for a reason. Horizon, meanwhile, is getting a longer cooldown for her Gravity Lift.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/kings-canyon-dropped-algs\">Apex Legends' Kings Canyon map dropped from ALGS competitions</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/teams/north/shuts-down\">North esports organisation to be shut down</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1612201603, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4050393736344518173", "title": "\u0421 \u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0434\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b Apex Legends \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0435\u0440 \u0424\u044c\u044e\u0437\u0430", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/Gamemag.ru/4050393736344518173", "is_external_url": true, "author": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "contents": "<img src=\"https://gamemag.ru/images/cache/News/News154112/dd974cfd2c-2_1390x600.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p>\u0421\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u044f\u00a0<strong>Respawn Entertainment</strong>\u00a0\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0435\u0440\u00a0\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b\u00a0<strong>Apex Legends</strong>, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u0410\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 <strong>\u0424\u044c\u044e\u0437</strong>. \u041e\u043d \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0435 2 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u043c \"\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0445\".</p>", "feedlabel": "Gamemag.ru", "date": 1611974160, "feedname": "Gamemag.ru", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4050393736342744544", "title": "ALGS Winter Circuit #1", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4050393736342744544", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Electronic Arts", "contents": "The Winter Circuit is coming!

Remember Mirage Voyage?</p>\n<p>But how does a game with a ranked play system and some of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/biggest-esports-games\">biggest esports tournaments</a> balance constant changes, how does the development team decide what needs adding to the meta of a battle royale game - and when do you stop?

In Ranked Season 7, 4.37% of players who played more than five hours of ranked achieved Diamond status, over twice as many as the previous season. More players also reached Platinum rank, and nearly twice as many hit Master and Apex Predator rank in Season 7 compared with Season 6 (0.2% compared with 0.12%).</p>\n<p>Looking forwards, in Season 8 Respawn is improving matchmaking, even at the expense of longer queue times.

This at least indicates that there may be more details to be revealed, either officially or otherwise, in the lead up to the Switch launch.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in the past week, two new posts have surfaced on the ApexUncovered subreddit, seemingly confirming that a February 2 launch is on the cards from Amazon's <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/l4ip4h/nintendo_switch_on_japanese_amazon_switch/\">Japanese</a> and <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/kymdbp/nintendo_switch_version_can_be_found_on_the/\">Mexican</a> sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/switch-release-date-leak\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Apex Legends Season 8 dishes out nerfs to Wraith and Horizon</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">Building a legend: Apex Legends developers on the evolution of a battle royale</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1611586012, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4043637702561761199", "title": "Apex Legends hits its highest concurrent player count on Steam", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/4043637702561761199", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apex-legends-pathfinder-900x506.jpg\"/><p>As Respawn prepares to launch <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends\">Apex Legends</a> Season 8: Mayhem, the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-battle-royale-game\">battle royale game</a> has never been more popular - at least not on Steam.

Players will undoubtedly log on to check out the new character, weapon, and of course start the battle pass - or at least have a look to see if the skins tickle their collective fancy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/player-count\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Apex Legends Season 8 dishes out nerfs to Wraith and Horizon</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">Building a legend: Apex Legends developers on the evolution of a battle royale</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1611572402, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4043637702550979148", "title": "Apex Legends Season 8 is totally demolishing Kings Canyon", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/4043637702550979148", "is_external_url": true, "author": "contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Imogen Beckhelling)", "contents": "<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/apex-legends-season-8.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2021/01/apex-legends-season-8-1212x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"681\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-933433\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>When Respawn said last week that the <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/apex-legends/\">Apex Legends\u2019</a> map Kings Canyon would be &ldquo;obliterated&rdquo; in Season 8, I thought perhaps this meant they were going to whack a giant crater somewhere and call it a day.

Hailing from the fringe world of Salvo, the overconfident Aussie has made some enemies on his way to King's Canyon, not least 'Mad' Maggie, his ex-best friend who resents his entry to the games.</p>\n<p>However, upon his inauguration to the competition, Maggie decides to take her revenge. While the latest mustachioed member of the games takes in the plaudits from the crowds and loads his rocket launcher with fireworks, little does he know all hell will soon break loose. Hell that will have permanent effects on the landscape of King's Canyon.</p>\n<p>Maggie hacks into Fuse's ship, aiming the cannons at the innocent crowds below. However, it's her big finale which will have the biggest impact on King's Canyon. She sets off bombs planted in the iconic mountains at the centre of the map, reducing them to mere rubble.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-kings-canyon-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/evolution-interview\">Building a legend: Apex Legends developers on the evolution of a battle royale</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fuse-abilities\">Apex Legends Fuse: abilities, trailer, and everything we know so far</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1611250238, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "4483864038820355149", "title": "Looks like Apex Legends is coming to Switch in February", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/4483864038820355149", "is_external_url": true, "author": "", "contents": "<img src=\"https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2021/articles/2021-01-19-11-46/looks-like-apex-legends-is-coming-to-switch-in-february-1611056795773.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/quality/90/format/jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Like so many things in 2020, last year the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-23-apex-legends-arrives-on-steam-this-november-alongside-season-7\">Switch version of Apex Legends had to be delayed due to the challenges of working in a pandemic</a>, but it looks like that port could be arriving rather soon.

He was in the middle of a stream when the problems began.</p>\n<p>The first was the fact that he could pop Shield Cells while his shields were full. While this is obviously a waste of resources, usually the game stops you from being able to do so. However, this was the least of his problems. Soon, Eriece's teammate Joshua 'Dazoh' Davis, who plays for EU team UNDERRATED, found that dropping loot on the walls of Countdown caused it to bounce up in the air.</p>\n<p>The anti-gravity bouncing only applied to loot dropped from players' inventories - so players and ground loot seemed unaffected. But, once something started bouncing, it just wouldn't stop.

After yet another mishap while serving in the prison canteen and the robot is falsely accused of murder, the unlikely duo are forced into each others' lives.</p>\n<p>As Maldera interrogates Pathfinder, he delves into the robot's data banks, but finds out more than he bargained for.

Aside from portalling DPS character Wraith, the most popular legends in competitive Apex are Wattson, who can garrison a position with electrified fences, and Gibraltar, whose fortified buff makes him harder to take down and whose Dome Shield can protect teammates from immediate danger.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/global-series-lynx-interview\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/horizon-lore-teaser\">Apex Legends: third lore teaser for Horizon appears in Olympus</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 7: ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-fuse\">Apex Legends Season 8: Mayhem introduces new legend Fuse</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1608313680, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3879252510628288048", "title": "Apex Legends fans are getting a novel of tasty new lore", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/3879252510628288048", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apex-legends-pathfinders-quest-novel-900x506.jpg\"/><p>In the battle royale genre, Apex Legends is unique in the fact that it leans so heavily on the in-game lore.

Get in on the festivities as we talk about the return of Winter Express and roll through some gift ideas for the legends in your life. \n\n[previewyoutube=X7Y2azaeKfo;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nHappy Holo-Days from everyone on the Apex Legends team! we\u2019re excited to share with you all we\u2019ve got planned for the rest of the year.\n\n[list]\n[*] A month of sales\n[*] Brand new wintery cosmetics\n[*] Return of a fan favorite mode from December 1 to January 4\n[*] An all-new rewards track\n[/list]\n\n[previewyoutube=BwKQLghOG20;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h2]A Month of Sales[/h2]\nCheck back every week from November 24 to January 4 for a new set of sales including all-new Loba, Revenant, and Spitfire Legendary Skins. \n\n[h2]Limited-time mode: Winter Express[/h2]\n\nHi everyone, I\u2019m Mark Yampolsky, Systems Designer on Apex Legends, and I\u2019m here to tell you about a fan-favorite mode we\u2019re bringing back this Holo-Day Season, now with some exciting changes!\n\nThe train is back in World\u2019s Edge just for Winter Express, and this time it\u2019s not the only vehicle descending into the valley around Epicenter. The supply ships from Kings Canyon are also flying around the frozen explosion.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/6a967f7444b5fbc386ac8abca9f9ee96395adf96.png[/img]\n\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t played it before, Winter Express is a round-based mode where three squads battle for control of the train as it makes its way around World\u2019s Edge. This year, when your squad respawns after a round has finished, you will spawn on your own supply ship as it follows the train. From here, your squad will be able to survey the battlefield and skydive into combat as the train arrives at its next station and the objective unlocks. The squad that won the previous round will respawn directly on the train.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/38753f3b74b57fea821130728138fe35c934691d.png[/img]\n\nWe\u2019ve also added a new station for the train to stop at: Derailment is the scene of a catastrophic accident that occurred as a cargo train travelling the opposite direction took a tricky turn at high speed. This new station has a variety of flanking opportunities, and a unique rotation under the bridge where the train stops. This allows you to quickly change which side of the objective you\u2019re attacking.\n\nThese changes should significantly reduce some of the long respawn times between rounds that players experienced last year. We can now spawn you earlier on the supply ships, and the longest section of track between stations is now divided in half with Derailment. We think these changes will make the mode an even more awesome experience.\n\nSome new Legends have joined the games since Winter Express was last live, including: Loba, Revenant, Rampart, and Horizon. These Legends shake up the mode in new, exciting ways and we can\u2019t wait for you to find new strategies for defending the objective or breaking through a powerful enemy line. We\u2019ve also refreshed and rebalanced loadouts for this mode to include new weapons and purple armor for more exciting engagements that really help show off what our Legends can do.\n\n[h2]Holo-Day Rewards Track[/h2]\n\nThis year, Holo-Day Bash contains a rewards track with all-new unlockables. The rewards track will be available the same time as Winter Express, December 1 to January 4.\n\nCheck out everything you can earn below:\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/7e6cc1dc1e67f082a93b673e89f38311d6291c32.jpg[/img]\n\nThat\u2019s all for now.

I remembered feeling uncomfortable as a child when I saw Tetra transform into Princess Zelda in The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker; I saw how the change was framed as an upgrade from an unremarkable brown pirate to an ethereal pale princess worth Herculean and Hyrulian efforts alike to save.

To answer community concerns, several members of the Apex Legends dev team recently held a Reddit Q&A in which they addressed the unpopular battle pass. But the team also touched on another topic: the worrying problem of crunch in the games industry. </p><p>The comment on crunch comes from Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier, who was responding to a player who wanted more LTMs and felt Respawn was being \"slow with content\". Grenier assured the commenter the team was not scared of LTMs, but explained they normally drop-off in interest after a few days, making a two-week format unsuitable. He then went on to state that Respawn was trying to avoid crunch - and content would perhaps release a little slower as a result. </p><p>\"We also refuse to crunch the team, so we'll probably be slower at making content than if we worked 15 hour days but that's just not something we're willing to do,\" <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/jpb4w3/were_the_team_who_brought_you_horizon_olympus_and/gbec1sj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">Grenier said</a>. \"We have nearly doubled our team size since launch to accommodate the content demands, so we're really trying to bring you quality content at a healthy pace.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-11-10-we-refuse-to-crunch-the-team-says-apex-legends-director\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1605018000, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3887130640411010988", "title": "Apex Legends Olympus map guide: best locations to land", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/3887130640411010988", "is_external_url": true, "author": "contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Ollie Toms)", "contents": "<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-907997 size-large\" title=\"Apex Legends Olympus map guide\" src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/11/olympus-apex-legends-1212x682.jpg\" alt=\"Apex Legends Olympus map guide\" width=\"1212\" height=\"682\"></p>\n<p>The third ever Apex Legends map, the floating island of Olympus, features quite a few differences from the previous two locations of Kings Canyon and World&rsquo;s Edge.

That's because there are only two methods of earning stars: completing daily and weekly challenges, or accrue 10,000 XP to earn one star.</p>\n<p>After hearing the criticism, Respawn has now taken action. While the distribution of stars for challenges will stay the same, weekly challenges will now take \"less time\" to complete. It has also slashed the amount of XP you need to hit to earn extra stars.

Join the designers as they discuss all the new stuff coming in Season 7 and breakdown some of the bigger changes coming to Legends and weapons.\n\n\n[h1]Season 7[/h1]\n\n[h2]New Legend: Horizon[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/558b135b895a0f329f6e6ed9fc38f4e4d14e821d.png[/img]\n\nMeet Horizon! She\u2019s the newest Legend, a brilliant scientist, and a master of  gravity manipulation. She has a deep connection to the new arena, and a motivation that will tug at your heartstrings. \n\nHorizon\u2019s custom space suit allows her to fall from great heights and control her movements in the air. Using her custom technology, she can use gravity lifts to give her team a vertical boost, and she can even deploy NEWT (her small robot named after her son, Newton) to drop a micro black hole that pulls opponents into the center for some serious crowd control.\n\n[b]Passive: Spacewalk[/b]\nIncrease air control and reduce fall impacts with Horizon\u2019s custom spacesuit.\n\n[b]Tactical: Gravity Lift[/b]\nReverse the flow of gravity, lifting players upward and boosting them outward when they exit.\n\n[b]Ultimate: Black hole[/b]\nDeploy NEWT to create a micro black hole that sucks in nearby Legends.\n\n\n[h2]New Map: Olympus[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/e576f4d842aabae92e376522336ec195ae941b6a.png[/img]\n\nThe Legends have entered a new arena: the sky city of Olympus. \n\nA utopia floating in clouds above Psamathe, it was once a place where the brightest minds in the Outlands could gather and exchange ideas. However, an accident in an experimental research facility led to the creation of the Phase Rift (a massive bubble of Phase energy), and the city was abandoned.\n\nNow players can use Olympus\u2019 luxurious amenities to their advantage. Rotating agricultural towers, beautiful gardens and classy restaurants serve as new stages for intense skirmishes. New vehicles called Tridents give your squad a way to boost into battle and take your enemies by surprise. The Phase Runner \u2013 a tunnel of Phase energy running through the center of Olympus \u2013 lets you cross the map in seconds. And the Rift stands tall over everything, mysterious and beckoning . . .\n\n\n[h2]New Vehicle: The Trident [/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/3885f31a86691fea55ef6e73b09ba48c46ee14c5.png[/img]\n\nExclusive to Olympus, the Trident is a hover car designed for your whole squad.\nCruise the highways to avoid chokepoints or use the boost to soar over jumps, this thing is made to speed up those early game rotations. Drive in third person, or ride as a passenger in first person with full shooting capabilities. The Trident is durable, so it will never explode, but damage applied from enemy fire will be dispersed amongst the players in the car. Don\u2019t worry, you can still do full damage to players by hitting them directly so we expect to see some amazing Kraber shots. Disembark to park it anywhere and use it as makeshift cover in the late game. \n\nThe Trident interacts with Legend abilities in many different ways, experiment and have fun!\n\n\n[h2]LTM: Olympus Preview[/h2]\nTo help you understand and explore the map without fear of getting shot, we are introducing a new playlist called Olympus Preview. This mode teams you up with 30 Legends on Olympus and allows you to roam the map to learn map drops, loot areas, and practice your routes to the end game. Circles are still on and once circle 4 finishes, players are brought back up to the plane to start the second skydive run. There are a total of 3 runs before the match ends. This mode is only available for one week. \n\n\n[h2]Clubs[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/f4adb0ce9fba962fae50854f5e9af2d22681a5de.png[/img]\n\nWith this season, we are introducing clubs. Join a club with like minded legends and make it easier to find your champion squad. Don\u2019t see a particular club you like, then create one and let your friends know to join! Read more on cubs [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-7-clubs]here[/url].\n\n[h2]Steam[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/ae146e34b9b578c5a78e99fdfe4b4ea1d900a5df.jpg[/img]\n\nBoot up Steam and start downloading and play Apex Legends! If you\u2019re coming from Origin, all your progress and unlocks will carry over. And for a limited time, log into Steam and receive these Half-Life and Portal inspired weapon charms. \n\n\n[h2]Battle Pass[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/49e20f3beae02bb77deecd04ba2ee32a5954f25a.png[/img]\n\nThe Season 7 Battle Pass is all about that high fashion. Level up your Pass to unlock the skins like the Wraith \u201cHigh Class\u201d and Octane\u2019s \u201cFast Fashion\u201d. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/74bf25da6ef7bcbf820aad4c199551d3aff6a1e4.png[/img]\n\nChallenges are no longer points-based and are now granted between 1 to 5 stars, depending on their difficulty. Collecting 10 stars will take you to the next Battle Pass level. We have also added tabs to the challenges menu in the lobby that allow you to toggle between daily, top weekly, and event challenges. Within a match, players can open the map and see this same widget in game.\n\nFor more on the changes to Challenges, check out this [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-7-simplified-challenges]dev blog[/url]. \n\n\n[h2]Quality of Life Updates[/h2]\n\n[h3]Attachment Swap Improvements[/h3]\nWhen replacing an attachment with one from the ground, if the old attachment is an improvement for your other weapon, the old attachment will get automatically transferred. \n\n[h3]Replicator Updates[/h3]\nFor Season 7, we have removed weapons from the crafting pool and have replaced them with Shield batteries. The high level attachments will still be tailored towards a weapon category.\nWe now prevent other players from picking up items that you crafted for the first 5 seconds after crafting.  This can be disabled by pinging the item.\n\n[h3]Air Drop Clarity[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] The colors of the beams have been changed to differentiate between normal airdrops, Lifeline's airdrops, and Replicator airdrops. Normal drops are a light tan, Lifeline's drops are blue, and Replicator drops and teal.\n[*] All of the airdrops' landing area FX while it's coming down matches their colors.\n[*] Airdrop beams still stay visible when close to the airdrop, instead of fading when you get close. The beam still disappears when the pod is opened.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Misc[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] The Arc Star now shows an Arc Star model when one is thrown near you, instead of a grenade.\n[*] Added a new VO line when you are using a Phoenix Kit\n[*] Added a new VO line when you drop a Holo Spray\n[*] You can now ping ammo in your inventory to request more from your squad\n[*] Made modifications to The Ring to reduce the amount of unplayable space in the circles.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h2]Map Rotations[/h2]\n\n[h3]Regular Map Rotation[/h3]\nFor 2 weeks, Olympus will be the only map you can play on. After that week we go into a normal rotation between Olympus and World\u2019s Edge. We will be vaulting Kings Canyon for the time being. \n\n[h3]Season 7 Ranked Rotation[/h3]\nThe first half of Ranked Split will be played on Olympus. The second half of ranked will be played on World\u2019s Edge. For more information on this season\u2019s ranked updates, check out the ranked blog [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-7-ranked]here[/url].\n\n\n[h2]Legend Meta[/h2]\n\n[h3]Bangalore[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Rolling Thunder:[/b] Reduced the time it takes for explosion from 8 seconds to 6 seconds.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: [/i]\nNot much to say here. Rolling Thunder will continue to function primarily as a zoning ability, but with a somewhat shorter fuse, it will encourage enemies to leave the zone slightly faster.\n\n[h3]Caustic[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Nox Gas Trap/Nox Gas Grenade:[/b] Legends no longer get a blurred vision effect while in the gas. Damage updated from 4-10 ticks of damage to 6-12 ticks of damage.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: [/i]\nFighting in Caustic Gas is one of the most frustrating things in Apex Legends, and yet we need the gas to represent a meaningful threat or else enemies will just ignore it. With this change we\u2019re attacking what we think is the greatest contributor to this frustration: the fact that your vision is blurred while you\u2019re in gas. This made it extremely hard to fight back. To make up for lost power, we\u2019re upping the damage from the gas a bit.\n\n[h3]Mirage[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Psyche Out/Life of the Party:[/b] Decoys now have 45 health\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note: [/i]\nOur bamboozler-in-chief is a hard Legend to keep relevant. Every time we make a change to decoys, there is a clear uptick in usage and power as Mirage mains learn to use their new tools, and then as the rest of the world catches on and starts being able to tell the real Mirage from his equally handsome holographs, that uptick disappears. This time around we want to try and make it a little bit harder to clear out decoys. We\u2019re giving them health, but to make this very clear up front: they will not work as a shield. While they take damage from bullets, the bullet also passes through them and hits whatever\u2019s behind them. This is what we call the hallway test: you should not be able to win an engagement against an enemy in a straight coverless hallway by snapcasting a decoy and having said decoy eat an entire Wingman shot. Decoys will also play unique hit effects and briefly flicker out of existence when taking damage to help you differentiate between them and the real Mirage.\n\n[h3]Octane[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Swift Mend[/b]: Doubled healing rate (from 0.5 hp/s to 1.0 hp/s)\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev note:[/i]\nOctane is a Legend for players who like to go fast, run face first into the enemy, and get knocked down a lot. We think that\u2019s absolutely fine; the fact that his Trios winrate isn\u2019t great doesn\u2019t really bother us because both his encounter win rate (think of this as his ability to score knockdowns) and his pick rate are very healthy. That said, we figured we could give him a little extra out of combat help. His passive\u2019s heal rate was very slow, requiring up to 200s to fully heal your health bar.\n\n[h3]Wattson[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Perimeter Security:[/b] Increased damage per touch from 10 to 15.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note:[/i]\nWattson is the anti-Octane: not super powerful individually, not picked very often at all below Plat, but an absolute must have for competitive squads. We\u2019re also happy with that niche, but figured it would be safe to give her a little extra power in her best case: people running into her fences. We\u2019re aiming for this to bring up her power and attractiveness at lower levels of play especially, since we don\u2019t see a lot of players run into Wattson fences in high skill matches.\n\n[h3]Loba[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Black Market[/b]: Ammo taken no longer counts towards Black Market\u2019s maximum. You can scoop up all the ammo in range.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note:[/i]\nWe\u2019re taking another swing at making Loba the ultimate Legend to bring to solve all of your team\u2019s loot needs. We have heard your feedback that you want improvements to her tactical as well, and while that\u2019s certainly not off the table, our data suggest that her encounter win rate (how many knockdowns she gets compared to how many times she\u2019s knocked down, across all matches) is quite healthy. It\u2019s her Trios winrate that\u2019s worryingly low. Make no mistake: this is a major swing at making Black Market powerful. \n\n[h3]Rampart[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Sheila:[/b] Now takes 1.25 seconds to fully spin up, down from 2 seconds.\n[*] [b]Amped Wall:[/b] Now takes 3 seconds to fully build, down from 4 seconds.\n[/list]\n\n\n[i]Dev Note:[/i]\nIn patch 6.1, we made a small change to how long it takes Sheila to tighten her bullet spread. This didn\u2019t meaningfully increase her winrate. The other half of that change is in this patch. We do not want to change Rampart away from being a Legend that requires setup, but we do want to make it faster to set up. Amped Wall should remain a mostly out of combat setup ability rather than a reactive ability and Sheila should remain an area denial tool rather than a murder machine, but like all things, these balance points exist on a spectrum, and with this patch we\u2019re moving them slightly closer to reactive/murder machine territory.\n\n[h3]Pathfinder[/h3]\n[i]Dev Note: [/i]\nPathfinder continues to be an overachiever in terms of win rate. The good news is that his grapple change in 6.1 didn\u2019t move his win rate by much (it went up 1% in total). We\u2019re doing two things this patch: we\u2019re adjusting his hitboxes and we\u2019re putting in tuning for Grappling Hook that will firmly move it into buff territory. More context below!\n\n[b]Hitbox[/b]: Pathfinder has a tall but extremely skinny hitbox. A lot of his model isn\u2019t actually shootable and particularly his arms and legs do not represent a lot of shootable area either. Here is a before and after comparison of Pathfinder\u2019s hitboxes:\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/a69f8f2e6a84cf052b2a4132accfa445683df5c6.png[/img]\n\nAs you can see, there is still a lot of negative space around his arms and legs. We\u2019re hoping that by making it a little easier to hit Pathfinder, we can bring his win rate under control to the point where we can put meaningful power into his kit.\n\nBecause the question is sure to come up: we are not yet removing Low Profile from Pathfinder with this change. Even with these increased hitboxes, Pathfinder will still be considerably harder to hit than most other characters in the game. If this change does make a meaningful difference in terms of his win rate we will drop Low Profile; but we really didn\u2019t want to take it off him this patch only to have to put it back next patch when it turns out his winrate spiked.\n\n[b]Grappling Hook[/b]: We\u2019re making a number of changes to Grappling Hook. In 6.1 we shipped a very conservative version of this change; now that we know this didn\u2019t meaningfully affect his winrate or, anecdotally, how frustrating it is to fight him, we\u2019re shipping the much more aggressive version of the changelist. We also want to make it clear that players should not be punished for chaining grappling hook perfectly into other movement mechanics.\n[list]\n[*] Pathfinder no longer needs to be on the ground for Grappling Hook to be considered finished.\n[*] The speed to which Pathfinder needs to drop for us to consider Grappling Hook finished was increased from 300 units/second to 500 units/second\n[*] The maximum cooldown grapple can be set to was lowered to 30 seconds, from 35 seconds; the maximum amount of travel time before a new cooldown is set is now 5 seconds, rather than being uncapped. This means that effectively, you can never incur more than a 35 second cooldown.\n[*] The amount of distance you can travel before you hit maximum cooldown was roughly doubled.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h2]Weapon Meta[/h2]\n[h3]Supply Drop[/h3]\n[b]R99 Out of Supply Drop:[/b] The R99 will be returning to the normal loot pool this season, with the same stats it had before it went into the supply drop at the start of season 6.\n[list]\n[*] Damage: 12 -> 11 (from Care Package version to normal pre-season 6)\n[*] Ammo 20/22/24/27\n[/list]\n\n[b]Prowler Into Supply Drop:[/b] The prowler is replacing the R99 in the supply drop.  Despite the Selectfire hop-up being removed from the loot pool this season, the Prowler will still have the ability to change between 5 round bursts and full-auto.\n[list]\n[*] Magazine size: 35; reserve ammo: 175\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Fully Kitted Weapons[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Removed: Devotion, Mastiff, Triple Take, Flatline, Volt\n[*] New: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Hemlok[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Increasing horizontal recoil of the first 3 shots slightly to the right (first burst when in burst mode)\n[*] Increasing recoil magnitude in the later stages of the pattern\n[*] Reducing recoil multiplier in single fire mode to help compensate for additional recoil in pattern. Recoil should mostly be increased in burst mode rather than single fire mode\n[*] Reducing headshot multiplier 2.0 -> 1.75 (44 -> 39 damage headshot against no helmet base character)\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes: [/i]\nWhile we are happy to see the Hemlok get more attention with the recent buffs, we think it is a little too strong in season 6. The effective range of the burst mode felt a bit too far, and the spike damage capabilities of a full headshot burst were too strong in high level play.\n\n[h3]Havoc[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Updated recoil pattern. Kicks up, then right, then left, then up again.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes:[/i]\nWith 6.0, the Havoc got a new recoil pattern. This new recoil pattern was a bit too erratic and difficult to control, due to multiple rapid changes in direction. We have adjusted the recoil pattern to have the same general movement while simplifying the motions required to control the pattern.\n\n[h3]LSTAR[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] LSTAR has a new recoil pattern that kicks horizontally at first and then settles into a relatively consistent upward recoil. Players who feather the trigger will be able to keep the LSTAR in the good portion of the recoil pattern.\n[*] LSTAR venting time after letting go of the trigger has been reduced 0.4s -> 0.15s.\n[*] LSTAR will now reduce heat faster when not overheated -- 1.15s from 99.9% to 0% charge if not overheated, still 2.45s if overheated.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes: [/i]\nThe LSTAR had some limitations that caused it to feel worse than we\u2019d like. The recoil pattern snaked back and forth, which was difficult to control reliably. Additionally, firing for short bursts and then releasing the trigger repeatedly, or \u201cfeathering the trigger\u201d, felt somewhat clunky due to the long venting time after firing and the slow heat reduction. So, we are reducing those pain points to improve the viability and feel of feathering the trigger, and adjusting the recoil pattern to reward players who can effectively control the LSTAR\u2019s heat.\n\n[h3]Sentinel[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Energized Sentinel now has a pure damage increase, instead of bonus damage only vs shields\n[*] Energized Sentinel base damage 70 -> 88\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Notes: [/i]\nThe Sentinel was still a bit weak. We think a good place to improve it is the energize ability. It seems a bit too situational, only being a benefit if the opponent has >70 shields. So, we are changing the energize from a \u201cdisruptor\u201d anti-shield effect to an \u201camp\u201d damage boost effect.\n\n[h3]Triple Take[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fire rate 1.3 -> 1.2\n[/list]\n\n[i]Dev Note:[/i]\nThe Triple Take is still performing a bit too well after the most recent nerf, so we are reducing the fire rate back to what it was before the 6.0 patch. We will be watching in the future to see how just the integrated choke, sniper ammo increase, and new popularity affect the weapon\u2019s performance.\n\n[h3]Hop-Ups[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Quickdraw Holster Hop-up:[/b] This new hop-up attaches to the RE-45 and Wingman.  When equipped, the gun becomes quicker to raise and lower, takes less time to ADS, and has reduced hipfire spread (particularly when not actively moving).  This should open up new opportunities to use the two weapons, especially in close-quarters combat.\n[*] The [b]Selectfire Receiver[/b] hop-up will be removed from the loot pool to make room.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Game Meta Changes[/h2]\n[h3]Evo Armor requirements increased[/h3]\nWe increased the requirements to evolve Evo Armor in order to reduce the amount of players with Red Evo Armor during the end game.\n[list]\n[*] Level 0 -> 1 : 100 damage (from 50)\n[*] Level 1 -> 2 : 150 damage (from 125)\n[*] Level 2 -> 3 : 300 damage (from 250)\n[*] Level 3 -> 4 : 750 damage (from 500)\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Ring damage reduced[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Ring 1: 2% per tick (same)\n[*] Ring 2: 3% per tick (from 5%)\n[*] Particularly this change should allow players enough time to pop a syringe if they are picked up in Ring 2.\n[*] Ring 3: 5% per tick (from 10%)\n[*] Ring 4: 10% per tick (from 20%)\n[*] Ring 5: 10% per tick (from 20%)\n[*] Ring 6: 15% per tick (from 25%)\n[*] Ring 7: 15% per tick (from 25%)\n[/list]\n\n\n[h2]Bug Fixes[/h2]\n[h3]Audio[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] We\u2019ve made some advancements in footstep audio playing more reliably. We have more work being done that we\u2019ll continue to roll out as it gets completed.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Pathfinder[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with ziplines going through platforms when deployed from underneath.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Wraith[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with priming a grenade cancelling Wraith's ultimate. \n[/list]\n\n[h3]Octane[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with getting stuck in double jump after using a jump pad. \n[*] Fixed an issue with Octane being able to use healing items while on a zipline. \n[/list]\n\n[h3]Crypto[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with his drone being able to drop items from Crypto\u2019s inventory.\n[*] Fixed an issue with his drone not being able to fit through certain windows. \n[*] Fixed an issue with his drone marking friendly Mirage decoys as enemies. \n[/list]\n\n[h3]Revenant[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with Revenant getting pushed into geo when his totem was deployed in tight spaces. \n[/list]\n\n[h3]Rampart[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with Rampart not being able to place an amp wall while jumping. \n[*] Fixed an issue with Sheila teleporting when placed on a hatch in World\u2019s Edge Staging. \n[/list]\n", "feedlabel": "Community Announcements", "date": 1604340109, "feedname": "steam_community_announcements", "feed_type": 1, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3884878205218672512", "title": "Apex Legends Season 7 \u2013 Ascension Gameplay Trailer", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/3884878205218672512", "is_external_url": true, "author": "Respawn Entertainment", "contents": "[previewyoutube=YV12-kknruM;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nApex Legends Season 7 \u2013 Ascension introduces new map Olympus, new Legend Horizon, the \u201cTrident\u201d vehicle, Clubs, fresh Battle Pass, Steam support and more! http://x.ea.com/64060\n\nRise to new heights in Apex Legends Season 7 \u2013 Ascension.

A solo queue experience in ranked is not the nicest experience, especially if you play at the top end of the Apex Legends ranks. So, in order to counter the toxic behaviour many complain about online, Respawn is adding a new social feature called Clubs feature for Season 7.</p>\n<p>Here players will be able to search for, or create, their own club once they hit level 10. These clubs currently only accommodate 30 members and will include a number of tags such as #RankedOnly or #MicRequired to bring like minded Apex Legends players together with the same goal in mind.</p>\n<p>The feature has been in the works since Season 4, according to designer Chad Armstrong, and was born out of Titanfall 2's Clans feature and the fact that many solo queue players often found themselves playing games with toxic randoms online. Statistics from trios games also suggested, unsurprisingly, that the majority of wins were being taken by \"full or partial squads,\" giving the design team a clear motivation for bringing this social feature to the battle royale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/clubs\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-battle-pass-additional-changes\">Apex Legends Season 7 Battle Pass gets another round of tweaks</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/quads-explainer\">Apex Legends won't have quads because three is \"the magic number\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 7 tier list</a></p>\n", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1604070063, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3884878205218417436", "title": "Apex Legends Season 7's vehicles lets us make noxious deathtraps", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/3884878205218417436", "is_external_url": true, "author": "contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Imogen Beckhelling)", "contents": "<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/apex-legends-horizon.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/apex-legends-horizon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-905977\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>A lush city in the sky, a time-travelling Scottish scientist and vehicles you can turn into gassy death machines.

While the Gibraltar was quite clearly in the wrong and was of course banned, his Bloodhound teammate, KongoBoom, was also shown in the video and subsequently banned as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/bloodhound-ban-nrg-lulu\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 7: Ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-7-patch-notes\">Apex Legends Season 7 patch notes - Horizon, Olympus, Trident, and more</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/clubs\">Apex Legends Clubs will bring 30 players together in Season 7</a></p>\n", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1603452240, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "5422856308630915478", "title": "Apex Legends raises wallrunning from the dead for this year's Fight Or Fright", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/5422856308630915478", "is_external_url": true, "author": "contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Natalie Clayton)", "contents": "<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/Apex-Legends-Wallrun-1212x681.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/Apex-Legends-Wallrun-1212x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"681\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-901915\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re doing it!

So when the recent <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-07-apex-legends-removed-wraiths-naruto-run-because-it-was-too-powerful\">Aftermarket update patch notes</a> mentioned a change to how the cooldown worked, many Pathfinder players thought their luck was in - until they saw the reality in practice. </p><p>The recent change altered Pathfinder's grapple cooldown so it would be measured based on distance travelled, with a longer grapple resulting in a longer cooldown. With the game measuring the grapple \"from the moment you leave the ground to when you're on the ground again and not sliding at crazy high speeds\", this means you're now less likely to be punished for accidentally shooting your grapple too early (which happens to us all). But should you want to use your grapple to slingshot and slide out of trouble, the seconds can really stack up.</p><p>Just take a look at the evidence below, in which a player effectively racks up a 42 second cooldown just for sliding on his bum after a grapple. This is because the cooldown timer only begins when Pathfinder has reached \"sprint speed\", and anything above that speed will not trigger the cooldown. For many players, this feels a little different to the 35 second \"maximum cooldown\" for long distances they were expecting from the recent patch notes, even if that's technically still true.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-09-pathfinders-grapple-change-wasnt-a-buff-after-all-says-apex-legends-dev\">Read more</a></p>", "feedlabel": "Eurogamer", "date": 1602258948, "feedname": "eurogamer", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3853351107553021874", "title": "A new Apex Legends glitch turns the Sentinel sniper rifle fully automatic", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/3853351107553021874", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/apex-legends-grand-soiree-bloodhound-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Sniper rifles often dominate shooting games - and for good reason. We all remember that bit in Saving Private Ryan when their sniper shoots the other sniper through the eyehole, right? They're brutal weapons, but that can sometimes lead to them being overpowered in video games. Even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone recently had to <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/as-val-sp-r-patch\">patch the SP-R sniper</a> because it was too strong, and Apex Legends is no different.</p>\n<p>The number of Charge Rifle beams you see shooting across the map are like deadly orange chemtrails with the sole aim of levelling up Evo Shields. The Triple Take can function as a shotgun as well as an effective sniper, and the Kraber one-shots opponents - if you can find it.</p>\n<p>However, the Sentinel has fallen short in recent months. Its 70 damage doesn't make up for the massive recoil and long reload times, so many players simply walk on by if they see one lying on the ground. However, all that has changed with a new bug in the latest Season 6 update, the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/cross-play-beta\">Aftermarket Event</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/sentinel-glitch-rapid-fire\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 6: Ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/release-date\">The adorable story of Apex Legends' odd lunchtime release</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/aftermarket-pathfinders-grapple\">Apex Legends Aftermarket update finally buffs Pathfinder's grapple</a></p>\n", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1602250935, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3853351107552543453", "title": "The adorable story of Apex Legends' odd lunchtime release", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/3853351107552543453", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/apex-legends-pathfinder-happy-waving-the-loadout-1080-1920-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Do you remember Apex Legends' release? Sure, February 2019 seems like a decade ago now, but it was a very exciting time for fans of both Titanfall and the battle royale genre. Apex is now in its seventh season, but lead programmer Jon Shiring shared a heartwarming tale that explains the game's odd lunchtime release and encapsulates Respawn's family values.</p>\n<p>Shiring was preparing to release Apex Legends in the morning of February 4. His role would mean he oversaw operations and online services for the game - which, obviously, is crucial for the basic functions of a battle royale.</p>\n<p>However, Shiring was due to attend a hearing regarding the adoption of his daughter around the same time. Unfortunately the court was unaware of the release date of Apex Legends - after all, it was a secret game at this point. He received his court appointment in the post, and to his disappointment, he was due in at 10.00 on February 4 - the exact time he was meant to be overseeing the launch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/release-date\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends Ranked Season 6: Ranks, splits, and scoring explained</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/sentinel-glitch-rapid-fire\">A new Apex Legends glitch turns the Sentinel sniper rifle fully automatic</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/aftermarket-pathfinders-grapple\">Apex Legends Aftermarket update finally buffs Pathfinder's grapple</a></p>\n", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1602239501, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3807188575867121138", "title": "Apex Legends cross-play beta goes live with Aftermarket update", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/3807188575867121138", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apex-legends-cross-play-900x506.jpg\"/><p>Apex Legends players will finally be able to play alongside friends on other platforms thanks to the battle royale's <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/aftermarket-event-crossplay-release-date\">Aftermarket update,</a> which introduces a cross-play beta.</p>\n<p>While a bunch of cosmetics and LTM events are being thrown in with the Aftermarket update, cross-play is by far the standout feature. The cross-play beta is Respawn's first attempt at matchmaking console and PC players together, as previously players were limited to facing opponents on the same platform.</p>\n<p>According to a blog post from Respawn, there are a few caveats to matchmaking. Players on PS4 and Xbox One will only be matched up with other console players, and will only find themselves facing PC players if they are in a squad with a friend who is a PC user. This separation has been made to limit the number of encounters between controller players and mouse and keyboard players.

At the time, Respawn said the huge increase was to ensure Pathfinder couldn't use his Grapple twice in one firefight, but fans thought the change was extreme and his usage dropped off in tournaments, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a>, and even casual games.</p>\n<p>Season 6 also sees Pathfinder's fellow Recon Legends Bloodhound and Crypto given the ability to use Recon Beacons, which in previous seasons was a trait unique to Pathfinder. The beacons give valuable intel on the next ring location, and Crypto's drone can scan them instantaneously, making him a better choice than Pathfinder. Bloodhound was also on the receiving end of a handful of buffs, making them a strong choice of Recon Legend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/pathfinder-buff-confirmed-by-producer\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/cross-play-beta\">Apex Legends cross-play beta goes live with Aftermarket update</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/aftermarket-event-crossplay-release-date\">Apex Legends gets cross-play, new cosmetics, Flashpoint LTM</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/kuben-blisk-leak\">Titanfall's Kuben Blisk might be a future Apex Legends character</a></p>\n", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1601039261, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3819572206286220658", "title": "The best PS4 games in 2020", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/3819572206286220658", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-warzone-fight-900x506.jpeg\"/><p>The best PS4 games are like pizza toppings when you think about it - everyone thinks their choice is the correct one, but really it all comes down to a myriad of personal tastes and preferences that are different for each individual.

Whether it's gas, hellfire, or 'unspecified zone', the ring dictates where the final stages of matches take place, forcing teams to rotate through unfavourable choke points or rewarding those with vantage points in the endgame.</p>\n<p>The Apex Legends ring, in particular, has its quirks and teams can often make predictions about its final position based on early information. However, as one of the few battle royales with large impassable mountains in the centre of the map and huge areas of steep cliffs and unswimmable ocean at the edges, some players have noticed the final circle can be very unkind. It is not unheard of for the circle to leave teams stranded between a cliff face and the deadly gas, or entirely finish over the ocean. Complaints about these situations affecting <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Apex Legends ranked</a> matches regularly hit the official subreddit or go viral on Twitter.</p>\n<p>However, this was rarely seen in competitive esports tournaments until last week. The final matches of the Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) wrapped up with victories for BlackBird Ventus, LYNX TH, Counter Logic Gaming, and GnaskeStrafeDel. However, in the latter stages of GSD's winning match, the final circle sat comfortably astride an impassable mountain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/improved-ring-logic-algs\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wraith-nerf-season-8\">Apex Legends players are abandoning Wraith after her latest nerf</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/MCD-winter-circuit-interview\">Life after North: How MCD won its first Apex Legends tournament without an organisation</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1600682664, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3819571572126230439", "title": "Apex Legends suspended its latest event due to a game-breaking bug", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/rps/3819571572126230439", "is_external_url": true, "author": "contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Imogen Beckhelling)", "contents": "<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/09/apex-dummies.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/09/apex-dummies.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-884885\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Last night, Respawn pulled out a little surprise for <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/apex-legends/\">Apex Legends</a> fans, dropping a new version of <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/01/15/apex-legends-grand-soiree-has-begun-inviting-players-to-its-biggest-party-yet/\">the Grand Soir\u00e9e event we first saw back in January</a>.

Our Apex Legends tier list helps you work out who's the best for climbing the ranks, but what use is that if you don't know what's going on?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/ranks\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-patch-notes\">Apex Legends Season 13 nerfs the Kraber and all LMGs</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/patch-notes\">Apex Legends patch notes - what's new in Season 13?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-13-start-time\">Apex Legends Season 13 start time - when does the new season begin?</a></p>", "feedlabel": "The Loadout", "date": 1651860243, "feedname": "The Loadout", "feed_type": 0, "appid": 1172470}, {"gid": "3978319116853982997", "title": "Apex Legends cross-play is coming - but console players won't be put in PC lobbies", "url": "https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/The Loadout/3978319116853982997", "is_external_url": true, "author": "editor@theloadout.com", "contents": "<img width=\"900\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apex-legends-octane-mirage-900x506.jpeg\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/cross-play-release-date-platforms\">Apex Legends cross-play</a> is finally on its way - but Respawn is going to avoid placing PC and console players in the same lobbies if possible.
